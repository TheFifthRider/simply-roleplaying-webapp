Generally speaking, special abilities don't need to be balanced. That said, we should inspect what it means to critically succeed if things were "unbalanced."



**Firebolt Cantrip** [   ]  [   ]
While you are equipped with equipment tagged with **Arcane** and **Focus**, you can spend an action and a use of this ability to make an attack with the equipment as if it had the **Fire**, **Long-Range**, **Close-Range**, **Weapon**, and **Knowledge** tags

add a couple more cantrips...

**Cantrips VI** [   ] [   ] [   ] [   ] [   ] [   ]
While you are equipped with equipment tagged with **Arcane** and **Focus**, you can spend a use of this ability to:

*    **Firebolt:** spend an action to make an attack with the equipment as if it had the **Fire**, **Long-Range**, **Close-Range**, **Weapon**, and **Knowledge** tags
*    **Prestidigitation:** spend an action to do something harmless and flavorful, like heating or cooling food, lighting torches, or cleaning/dirtying clothes
*    **Mage Hand:** spend an action to create an arcane hand that can manipulate objects within **Close-Range**. It can lift five pounds and apply five pounds of force.
*    **Dancing Lights:** spend an action to create up to four ethereal sources of light (flavored as you choose) within **Close-Range** for the scene. They spreead light like torches and you can only have four active at once.
*    **Message:** spend an action to whisper a sentence or two to a character you point to within **Long-Range**. That character hears the whispered message in their mind, and knows you sent it.

...then remove the cost.

What if all buffs were through advantages, and dealing raw damage was a separate thing?
