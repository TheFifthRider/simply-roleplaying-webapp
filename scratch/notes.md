Make backgrounds into combine two dice into one background. They're too costly now.

HP starts assuming players are dealing an average of 9 damage (d12+3), not 6. Should be around 20.

Do something to keep attributes roughly within the same ballpark. 0-3 is fine for level 1, but 20-30 is more appropriate for level 10.



# Attribute Specialization

Attributes all start at +0, and range from +2 to -2. Whenever you level up, you can choose one attribute to specialize in and give it +1. If you do, you must also choose one attribute to be weak in and give it -1.

## Ex: Maxine Level

*   Level 10, +2 BWN, +1 WIL, -1 PRE, -2 KNW
