**1 Potential**

*   Learn / level up skill / legacy
    *   X => d4 => d6
    *   ~= +1 power in a specific context
    *   cap = d12
*   Increase HP by 1

**2 Potential**

*   Level up attribute
    *   +1 => +2
    *   ~= +1 power in a more general context
    *   Attributes should be roughly half as big as skills/legacies/backgrounds
    *   Cap = level * 3
*   Increase Ability Points by 1

**5 Potential**

*   Learn a new Ability or improve an existing Ability
    *   Variable power, impossible to really balance against
    *   Most players will pick bonuses over new capabilities

new die every:
12 potential for HP
12 potential for AP
10 potential for BG
10 potential for Abilities
= ~45 potential, ~15 sessions, 60 hours (:aaa:, but I can always )



Every session, maximum of:

*   +4 skills
*   +2 attributes
*   +1 attribute, +2 skills / legacies
*   +1 ability, +1 skill / legacy
*   +2 HP, +1 AP
*   +1 skill, +1 HP, +1 attribute
*   etc.
