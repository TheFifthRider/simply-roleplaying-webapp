*   **Bitchin' Abs III**
    *   If I get hit and no bogus armor is equipped and holding me back, I can spend a point of Mayhem to make my rock hard abs +9 Brawn Armor for that attack and the rest of the scene.
*   **Max it Out IV:** You can spend an action and a point of Mayhem to create a **1d12** **MAXIN' OUT** advantage. 
    Each time you attack, give yourself another **1d12** to the advantage.
    The first time you take damage each round, give yourself another **1d12** to the advantage.
    * **Max Toughness:** When you are attacked while you have dice in the **MAXIN' OUT** dice pool, you can spend a die from the pool to roll it and ignore that much damage from an attack.
    * **Max Relentlessness:** If taking damage would cause you to be **defeated** while you have dice in the **MAXIN' OUT** dice pool, you can spend a die from the pool to not be defeated by that damage.
    * **Max Pounce:** When you first create the **MAXIN' OUT** advantage, you can move 3 spaces towards an enemy in the same action.
*   **(W)reckless:** When you attack, you can give yourself a **1d12** **Swinging Wildly** disadvantage to add **1d12** to the roll.
*   **Danger Senses Danger:** When you make a test of ability to avoid danger, add **1d12** to the roll.
*   **Raised by Bears II:** By spending some downtime with them, you can understand and be understood by animals near you. 
    * When you do, you can choose one of them-- for the next scene, you can see through their senses instead of your own.
*   **Un-_bear_-able Strength:** When you make a test of brawn to push, pull, lift, or break stuff, add **1d12** to the roll.
*   **Feral Instinct:** If you don't have the first turn in an action scenario, the person who goes first has to pass to you at the end of their turn.
*   **Crit to the MAX III:** When you **Critically Succeed** on an attack, add **1d12** to the roll _(before doubling it for damage)_ and create a **2d12** bonus dice pool on your victim called **Brutally Wounded**.
*   **I'll Check with my Ghost Bear Dad:** By spending some downtime, you can summon a bear spirit who magically grants you a success on **gathering information** about the natural world within 3km of you above ground, or within 300m underground. _(You may ask the GM up to 3 questions about anything natural to the area, which the GM must answer truthfully.)_
*   **Max Minimum:** Whenever you make a test of brawn you can spend a point of mayhem to replace whatever you rolled with your passive brawn.
*   **BREAKIN THE MAX:** Your brawn gets an extra +1, even if that pushes you over the attribute cap.
