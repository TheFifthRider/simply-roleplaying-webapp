                <h1 id="skills-and-backgrounds">Skills and Backgrounds</h1>
<p>Where attributes represent the intrinsic attributes of a character (their strength, speed, etc.), skills and backgrounds represent the training and expertise that same character has gained over time. <strong>Skills</strong> represent the individual trained abilities and <strong>backgrounds</strong> represent broad mastery gained by combining several mastered skills together.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="honing-your-skills">Honing your Skills</h2>
<p>A character's proficiency with the skills they know is represented by a die; four sided through twelve sided. The more proficient a character is with a skill the larger the size of the die in question. A character who has a d4 in a skill is considered to understand the bare minimum, where a character who has a d12 in a skill is considered to have mastered that skill. <a href="../../getting_started/dice/">If you're not familiar with the concept of dice sizes you can read about them here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../getting_started/creation/">Characters created in Simply Roleplaying</a>, can start anywhere from seasoned adventurers to fledgling recruits, brimming with potential. <strong>Potential</strong> is a measure of your character's ability to learn new skills or grow existing skills, given a competent teacher and time to learn. During <a href="../../getting_started/creation/">character creation</a>, the gamemaster will allot all of their players with a standard amount of potential to start the game with. Additional potential is earned <a href="../../gameplay/advancement/">at the end of every session</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="spending-potential">Spending Potential</h3>
<p>Players can spend potential in one of two ways: either by being trained in a skill by a more experienced character or by experimenting on their own and gaining insight in a skill. In either case they can choose to either <strong>learn</strong> the skill if they did not already know it, writing it down as a d4 skill on their character sheet, or <strong>level up</strong> the skill, increasing the size of the skill's die to the next largest size.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 id="training">Training</h4>
<p>Training is an intense period of study that characters can engage in over a period of several hours of <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/#training-a-skill">downtime</a>, given either a trainer or suitable materials to study from. At the conclusion of the <strong>training</strong>, as long as it was not significantly interrupted, the potential is spent and the character learns or levels up the trained skill. A character can act as a trainer for a skill provided that they have either mastered it or it pertains to one of their backgrounds.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 id="gaining-insight">Gaining Insight</h4>
<p>At any point after determining the result of a skill check, a player may declare that their character has <strong>gained insight</strong> in either a skill that was used for that check or in a skill that could have been used for that check. When they do this, they may either learn or level up the trained skill.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 id="renaming-a-skill">Renaming a Skill</h4>
<p>Leveling up a skill can also be an opportunity to refine it. Whenever you level up a skill, whether through training or gaining insight, you can also rename it to better represent the skill that your character is developing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A character with the skill <em>Spotting Traps</em> narrowly avoids the last arrow trap of a dungeon and <em>gains insight</em>, spending a point of potential to level up the skill. As they reflect on how it might be less useful back above ground, they decide to rename the skill to <em>Quick Reflexes</em> as they level it up.</p>
<p>A character with the skill <em>Research</em> spends days trying to crack the secrets of an alien artifact, working with a librarian to help train them in getting better at researching. To represent both the newfound knowledge and to help them get more specific answers in the future, they decide to rename the skill to <em>Extraterrestrial Research</em> as they level it up. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="mastering-a-skill">Mastering a Skill</h3>
<p>When you level a skill up to d12, you've <strong>mastered</strong> it and can't level it up anymore. If you want to get more skilled in this area, you'll have to create a background with the skill.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="forgetting-a-skill">Forgetting a Skill</h3>
<p>Sometimes a skill might not work out for your character. Maybe it was too specific, just isn't very useful in the long term, or your character has had a shift in priorities such that the skill no longer makes sense for them. In that case, you can always choose to <strong>forget</strong>. During any period of <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/#forgetting-a-skill">downtime</a>, you may decrease the die level of one of your skills to reclaim one point of potential, representing your character losing interest in or forgetting about that skill in preparation to learn something new.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="building-a-background">Building a Background</h2>
<p>Once a character has three related d12 skills, they can take a few hours of <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/#creating-a-background">downtime</a> to reflect and combine them together to form a <strong>background</strong> that summarizes the aspect of the character that is reflected by those three skills. Backgrounds can be added to any test that their name implies that they would be useful for and are worth a d12 when added to a test.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A character had mastered the skills <em>Acrobatics</em>, <em>Lockpicking</em>, and <em>Sneaking</em>, it would make sense for them to be able to combine them together into a background called <em>Thief</em>, since all of those skills are the kind a Thief might have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a character develops a new background, the skills combined into that background are erased from their character sheet, as their new background includes those skills. That is not to say that skills combined into a background cannot be learned again, however--  if they are, those skills represent additional expertise beyond what the character already has from their background. </p>
<h3 id="leveling-up-backgrounds">Leveling up Backgrounds</h3>
<p>If a character has three d12 skills that are related to one of their existing backgrounds, instead of creating a new background they can choose to level an existing background up. Higher leveled backgrounds can be used multiple times on a test, up to a number of times equal to their level.</p>
<p>To level up a background, a character takes a few hours of <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/#leveling-up-a-background">downtime</a> and erases the three related d12 skills, just like when creating a background. Then, they rename the background to represent the expertise gained and mark down the new level of the background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A roguish character with a <em>Thief</em> background has mastered Dexterity, <em>Sneaking</em>, and <em>Traps</em>. These skills all are relevant to the <em>Thief</em> background so rather than add a new background they choose to level up their existing background. These skills represent their abilities beyond being a thief, so they rename their background to <em>Master Thief (Level 2)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="renaming-a-background">Renaming a Background</h3>
<p>Characters change. Getting better at the stuff your backgrounds reflect can be easily shown by creating new backgrounds that represent the new skills you've learned. However, sometimes it makes sense for the name of a background to change to better reflect the character that it's representing.  A <strong>Bloodthirsty Warlord</strong> may become a <strong>Repentant General</strong>, an <strong>Assassin for Hire</strong> may become a <strong>Silencer of the Court</strong>, or a <strong>Master Blacksmith</strong> might become the <strong>Silversmith of Ardent</strong>. Sometimes the change is less story driven and more that you've come up with a better name to describe that grouping of skills. That's fine too! Backgrounds should be renamed until you're happy with them. After all, backgrounds exist to express your character.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="skill-and-background-naming-guidelines">Skill and Background Naming Guidelines</h2>
<p>As you may have already figured out, skills are almost entirely determined by the players; there is no master list of skills. This means the sky's the limit as far as creating a skill or background goes. While some modules-- like the Simply Combat module --may define specifically named skills and backgrounds that have specific requirements or capabilities, a skill can usually be anything you train at-- from Juggling to Basket Weaving -- and backgrounds are even more freeform.</p>
<p>The trickiest part about being able to create your own skills or backgrounds is coming up with a good name. You want your names to keep a balance between the general and the specific. Ideally, your skills and backgrounds should both be expressive of what you want your character to be able to do while still remaining general enough that they can come up a lot in play.</p>
<p>Don't worry too much about coming up with the perfect name for a skill or background. It's good enough to just create a good name. Skills ultimately exist to be mastered and turned into backgrounds and backgrounds should be renamed until they feel right.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="naming-a-good-skill">Naming a Good Skill</h3>
<p>Names for skills are fairly rigid. Skills should describe a specific thing that your character has trained in. The more general the name of a skill is, the more generic the character's expertise is considered to be. A character with a <em>History</em> skill would be able to apply it to broad questions about the past of a town, but wouldn't likely be able to apply that knowledge to find the age of the ancient catacombs under the town like a character with an <em>Archeology</em> skill. Conversely, a character with an <em>Archeology</em> skill wouldn't likely be able to apply it to uncovering facts about the recent political unrest of the town.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="naming-a-good-background">Naming a Good Background</h3>
<p>Names for backgrounds are more freeform. A good rule of thumb is to name your background something that you might use in a sentence to describe your character. Backgrounds could be jobs like <em>Blacksmith</em>, <em>Hacker</em>, or <em>Guerilla Sniper</em>, roles like <em>Healer</em>, <em>Tactician</em>, or <em>Tank</em>, or even quick descriptions like <em>Born in a Port City</em>, <em>Penny Pincher</em>, or <em>Iron Will</em>. Really, there's not much of a definition for what a background can or can't be; if it sums up both an aspect of your character and a spectrum of skills, it's probably a good background!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="additional-skillbackground-examples">Additional Skill/Background Examples</h3>
<p>Here are some additional examples of skills based on a attribute they work well with, and some background examples of how they might be combined. While skills are never limited by what attribute you use them with, sometimes thinking about what attribute you want to improve will help you decide on what kind of skill to learn.</p>
<p>Skills to augment <em>Agility</em> tests primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are <em>Acrobatics</em>, <em>Rubix Cube Solving</em>, and <em>Sneaking</em>. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named <em>Criminal Mastermind</em>.</p>
<p>Skills to augment <em>Brawn</em> tests primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples are <em>Breaching Doors</em>, <em>Lifting</em>, and <em>Swimming</em>. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named <em>Military Commando</em>.</p>
<p>Skills to augment <em>Intuition</em> tests primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples are <em>Driving</em>, <em>Gambling</em>, and <em>Streetwise</em>. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named <em>Getaway Driver</em>.</p>
<p>Skills to augment <em>Knowledge</em> tests primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples are <em>Bandit Culture</em>, <em>Political History</em>, and <em>Sewing</em>. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named <em>Gang Savvy Granny</em>.</p>
<p>Skills to augment <em>Presence</em> tests primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples are <em>Animal Handling</em>, <em>Bluff</em>, and <em>Political Appeal</em>. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named <em>Druid Politician</em>.</p>
<p>Skills to augment <em>Will</em> tests primarily focus on a character's ability to shut out distractions or act despite hardship. Some examples are <em>Acting under Pressure</em>, <em>Ignoring Pain</em>, and <em>Spirit</em>. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named <em>Force of Nature</em>.</p>
