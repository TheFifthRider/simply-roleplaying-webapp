<p><strong>Abilities</strong> are the special things that your character can do, the things that make your character mechanically unique. Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the <a href="../equipment/#weapon">weapon</a> tag, their unique <a href="../../extras/powers/">power</a> allows them to do something extraordinary, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details!</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-an-ability">What makes an Ability?</h2>
<p>An ability has a <strong>trigger</strong> that describes when it happens, and an <strong>effect</strong> that describes what it does. Many abilities also have a <strong>cost</strong> to activate them, which we'll go into later. A finished ability reads something like this: </p>
<table>

<p>If you choose to <strong>gain a new ability</strong>, your character learns a new ability. If your GM has a list of abilities for you to choose from, you can choose one of those, or you can create your own.</p>

<p>When you create an ability, you can choose to have it share the same charge as an existing ability. Choose an ability that you already have, increase the charge of the existing ability by one, and add a new trigger and effect to represent the new ability. </p>
<p>Once an ability has more than two or three charges, it is likely that the ability represents a core gameplay mechanic for your character. Consider naming the charges as a resource of some kind-- about what they're drawing upon to perform this ability and come up with a name for a resource that can be used to represent the charges.</p>

<h2 id="improving-existing-abilities">Improving Existing Abilities</h2>
<p>If you choose to <strong>improve an existing ability</strong>, you can either give an ability an extra effect or strengthen that ability in some way.</p>
<h3 id="giving-an-ability-an-additional-effect">Giving an Ability an Additional Effect</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. Adding an extra effect to an existing ability is fairly straightforward-- simply choose a new effect and add it to your ability's existing trigger. The strength of the effect should be comparable to or less than the strength of the initial effect for the ability.</p>
<h3 id="making-an-ability-stronger">Making an Ability Stronger</h3>
<p>If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. Generally, this amplification can be done by increasing the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broadening the situations in which the ability can apply. Here are some effects and how you might strengthen them:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>Effect</th>

<h2 id="cost-and-ability-points">Cost and Ability Points</h2>
<p>Many abilities have a <strong>cost</strong> that limit how often they can be used. A ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, or even simply tire the character using them by depleting their mana, chi, or other source of energy.</p>
<p>Consider what drives your character, and what makes them able to do the incredible things they do. Whatever it is, that is the name of your type of <strong>ability points</strong>. If you can't think of one, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later.</p>
<p>You start with a pool of two ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/#recovering">spend some downtime to recover</a> or when it makes sense that you would.</p>
<h3 id="additional-and-alternate-costs">Additional and Alternate Costs</h3>
<p>Your GM may say that some abilities require costs other than ability points. This is especially true of abilities that permanently create or enhance <a href="../equipment/">equipment</a>, which often have costs associated with the materials, tools, and space needed to perform the enhancement. These costs may replace the ability point cost, or may be in addition to the ability point cost depending on what makes sense.</p>
<h3 id="passive-abilities">Passive Abilities</h3>
<p>Not all abilities need to be limited by how often they can be used, like a martial artist's natural ability to use their fists as a <a href="../equipment/#Weapon">weapon</a>. If it doesn't always make sense for an ability to have a charge, talk to your gamemaster about making the ability a <strong>passive ability</strong>.</p>
<p>Passive abilities are simply abilities which do not have charge. Gamemasters and players should expect to workshop passive abilities more than active abilities. In addition, consider adding additional triggers that all must be satisfied to use the effect, or weakening the effect compared to an ability with a charge.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives-to-ability-points">Alternatives to Ability Points</h3>
<p>If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it.</p>
<p>If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities.</p>
