                <h1 id="abilities">Abilities</h1>
<p><strong>Abilities</strong> are the cool mechanics that show off what makes your character awesome. Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the <a href="../equipment/#weapon">weapon</a> tag, their <a href="../../setting_rules/powers/">power</a> over gravity allows them to temporarily lift massive objects, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details!</p>
<p>This section is written assuming that players and GMs will work together to create cool abilities, but you can also decide to create and curate a list of abilities that characters are able to choose from and that's a fine way to play too! That's the way most TTRPGs work, after all.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-do-abilities-do">What do Abilities do?</h2>
<p>Abilities do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway.</p>
<p>Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them. If you want to make an ability called <em>Godmode</em> that <em>makes you immortal.</em> Go for it. Just make sure you check with your GM and the rest of the table-- they may not want to play a TTRPG where somebody has cheat codes on. Of course, that's not to say that characters shouldn't be overpowered! Protagonists with the ability to shape the world to their whim can create a compelling story. Just make sure that everyone is on the same page and having fun, that's what matters.</p>
<h3 id="ok-but-what-do-they-usually-do">Ok, but what do they usually do?</h3>
<p>Often, a character's abilities will do things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflict <a href="../health/">damage</a></li>
<li>Make a test to heal <a href="../health/">damage</a></li>
<li>Create <a href="../../gameplay/bonus_dice/">bonus dice</a><ul>
<li>...which could be <a href="../../gameplay/bonus_dice/#Special Advantages and Disadvantages">special bonus dice</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give some <a href="../equipment/">equipment</a> a specific <a href="../equipment/#the-full-list-of-tags">tag</a></li>
<li>Allow someone to do something as if they had equipment with a specific <a href="../equipment/#the-full-list-of-tags">tag</a></li>
<li>Move the character where they want to be</li>
<li>Move someone else where the character wants them to be</li>
<li>Do something narratively extraordinary (for instance, using <a href="../../setting_rules/powers/">powers</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a <a href="../../gameplay/tests/">Test of Ability</a> to resist the effects, setting the <strong>Difficulty</strong> and describing what happens if they <strong>Critically Succeed</strong>, <strong>Succeed</strong>, <strong>Partially Succeed</strong>, or <strong>Fail</strong>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Every ability has <strong>requirements</strong> that must be met for you to be able to use it. The more requirements an ability has, or the more costly the requirements, the more powerful the ability should be. Often, requirements will be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wielding a specific tool, like being required to <em>use weapons specific to your art</em> to use a martial arts technique</li>
<li>Being in a specific situation, like being required to be <em>defending against a melee attack</em> to perform a counter</li>
<li>Taking a specific amount of time, like being required to <em>spend some downtime</em> to create a potion</li>
<li>Fulfilling a specific narrative goal, like being required to <em>memorize a character's mannerisms</em> to disguise yourself as them</li>
<li>Spending a specific resource, like being required to <em>spend mana</em> to cast a spell (usually, spending ability points)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-requirements">Optional Requirements</h3>
<p>You can make an ability more flexible by making it stronger if more requirements are met. These <strong>optional requirements</strong> are often things like spending extra ability points, taking additional time, or fulfilling an extra goal. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Craft a Disguise</strong>
  If you've spent at least one period of downtime every day for the last seven days observing a character, you can disguise yourself as that character. You automatically pass as them visually and at a distance.<br/><em>If you've spent at least two periods of downtime each day observing them,</em> you better understand their mannerisms. You automatically pass as them when interacting with all but their closest friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="ability-points">Ability Points</h2>
<p>Consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do?  An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of <strong>ability points</strong>. If you're not sure, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later-- but it is a good idea to come up with a name for them later. It helps to make the flavor of your character come to life!</p>
<p>You start with a pool of <strong>2</strong> of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/#recovering">spend some downtime to recover</a>. You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their <em>mana</em> from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their <em>ammunition</em> in an arsenal.  A leader might replenish their <em>pride</em> from cheering throngs of admirers.</p>
<h3 id="creating-multiple-types-of-ability-points">Creating Multiple types of Ability Points</h3>
<p>Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their <em>mana</em> to use abilities related to their magic power might also have <em>flourishes</em> that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both <em>ammunition</em> for their arsenal of weapons and <em>psi points</em>. An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions.</p>
<p>You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you only gain that many ability points in total-- you must choose which of your types of ability points increase.</p>
<h3 id="customizing-ability-points">Customizing Ability Points</h3>
<p>If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it.</p>
<p>If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="gaining-ability-points-and-creating-abilities">Gaining Ability Points and Creating Abilities</h2>
<p>Every <strong>10 potential you earn</strong> (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two.</p>
<p>Any number of times between sessions you can reduce your maximum ability points by <strong>1</strong> to <a href="#creating-an-ability">learn a new ability</a>, or reduce your maximum ability points by <strong>2</strong> to <a href="#improving-existing-abilities">improve an existing ability</a>. If you happen to have multiple pools of ability points you may reduce any one of them by <strong>1</strong> to learn a new ability, or <strong>2</strong> to improve an existing ability. You can also reduce two of them by <strong>1</strong> to improve an existing ability.</p>
<p>Similarly, between sessions you can remove abilities from your character sheet if you feel like they don't belong-- whether you just don't like how they work or if you feel like they don't make sense to your character anymore. If you do, make sure you increase your maximum ability points to compensate for the points you spent to earn that ability.</p>
<p>If you made up new abilities or improvements, it's a good idea to make sure you take some time to talk them over with your table and/or your GM before you introduce them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="upgrading-abilities">Upgrading Abilities</h2>
<p>As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either <strong>give them an extra effect</strong> or <strong>make them stronger</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="giving-an-ability-an-additional-effect">Giving an Ability an Additional Effect</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. If an ability gave you an extra <strong>d6</strong> when gathering information about a monster, giving it an extra effect might allow you to create a <strong>1d6</strong> <a href="../../gameplay/bonus_dice/">bonus</a> named <em>I know</em> [monster name]<em>'s strengths and weaknesses</em> as well. If an ability allowed you to give equipment the <em>blessed</em> and <em>weapon</em> tags, adding an extra effect might let you make a test of <em>presence</em> to heal the wielder too!</p>
<h3 id="making-an-ability-stronger">Making an Ability Stronger</h3>
<p>If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. If an ability would push a target away from you, a stronger version of the ability might be able to push everyone within a <em>close range</em> of you away instead. If an ability would grant you an extra <em>d4</em> when wielding weapons tagged with <em>cleaving</em>, a strengthened version of the ability might give you an extra <em>d4</em> with <em>cleaving</em> or <em>hooking</em>-tagged <em>weapons</em>. Stronger abilities typically increase the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broaden the situations in which an ability might apply.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="abilities-growing-with-level">Abilities Growing with Level</h2>
<p>When making an ability, you may not want all aspects of the ability to be improved by a player choosing to <strong>improve an ability</strong>-- increasing the difficulties for tests, the size of bonus dice, or the <strong>+X</strong> tag on ability-created equipment aren't things that necessarily feel rewarding to level up. Improving an ability should always feel like an improvement, it should never feel like keeping up.</p>
<p>To that end, certain aspects of abilities should increase automatically as a character levels up. Bonus dice granted by an ability, for example, might start as d4s at level 1 and increase every two levels until level 8, when they become d12s. Test difficulties might increase by 10 every level. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Die</th>
<th>Equipment Quality</th>
<th>Test difficulty</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1d4</td>
<td>+0</td>

</tr>

<p>You can also tie effects to things that are automatically improved every level like health, passive ability scores, and total dice.</p>

<h2 id="lets-make-some-abilities">Let's Make Some Abilities</h2>
<p>All right, we've spent enough time talking about how they work. Let's make some ability points and an ability to use them.</p>
<h3 id="tinkering-inventor">Tinkering Inventor</h3>
<p>What if our character was a <em>Tinkering Inventor</em>? Someone who can always make the right tools for the job. Their abilities could be the inventions they create, powered by the <strong>scrap</strong> that the Inventor uses to make them. One ability could be <strong>Springloaded Boots</strong>-- a cobbled together contraption that allows the wearer to leap further and run faster... until it breaks. That's pretty easy to represent as bonus dice that the Inventor puts together over some downtime.</p>
<p>Ability points: <strong>Scrap</strong>
Ability: <strong>Springloaded Boots</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Requirements</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can...</td>
<td>...give 1 target 4d4 bonus dice called Springloaded Boots.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And upgrading it would probably mean making the boots last longer and be more durable, so we can just increase the number of bonus dice.</p>

<p>What if our character was an <em>Alchemist</em> who produced poisons and potions?

<h2 id="improving-an-ability-throughout-a-campaign">Improving an Ability Throughout a Campaign</h2>
<p>Here's a more in-detail example of how one could make an ability stronger over the course of multiple enhancements.</p>
<p>Let's start with the ability <strong>Berserking</strong></p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>A good starting point, but let's see if we can make it more interesting.</p>
<p>The next chance we get to improve abilities, we choose to <strong>make the ability stronger</strong>. We can't increase the number of dice that we have, but we can change the dice into an <strong>bonus dice</strong> that can be used more than once. Since bonus dice are more broadly useful than just attacks, let's also change the trigger to an action.</p>
<h4 id="berserking-ii">Berserking II</h4>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Requirements</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to...</td>
<td>...create 2d4 bonus dice named <strong>Berserking</strong> for the scene.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Already this is looking jucier. Now, not only do we get a 1d4 bonus to attacks, but we can also spend the dice from the bonus dice for breaking down doors, resisting mind control, and all kinds of other stuff that having <strong>Berserking</strong> bonus dice might help with.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Well, a simple route would just be to increase the number of dice that we have on the Berserking bonus dice to get more Berserking Time, but what if we made them special bonus dice? We'd need our gamemaster's approval and their help making some balanced tweaks, but with their help we could come up with something like...</p>
<h4 id="berserking-iii">Berserking III</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berserking</strong></p>
<p>When you <strong>make an attack</strong> add 1d4 to these bonus dice.
The first time you <strong>take damage</strong> each turn, add 1d4 to these bonus dice.
If you end your turn without spending one of these bonus dice, they are all lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what our gamemaster helped us come up with. They're special bonus dice that feeds themselves the more that we attack and take damage, but have the downside of needing to be used at least once on each of our turns or they go away. Now we're really getting somewhere! </p>
<p>But... what if we could make it <em>even better?</em> Our gamemaster has an idea for that-- they say that if we want to, we can upgrade the ability again to remove the restriction that causes us to lose the bonus dice.</p>
<h4 id="berserking-iv">Berserking IV</h4>

</blockquote>
<p>Wow. We are now three improvements deep into this ability and it feels pretty powerful indeed. By spending just one of our resources, we get powerful  these dice that we can feed off of making attacks and taking damage, like a true berserker might. If we play our cards right, we'll be adding dice front, left, and center all battle long!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="keeping-it-all-balanced">Keeping it All "Balanced"</h2>
<p>Gamemasters, as you've been reading through this section you're probably wondering if there's some kind of behind-the-scenes mechanic for making a balanced ability. The short answer is: there isn't.</p>
<p>The longer answer is there isn't, but not for a lack of trying. I spent quite some time working out various systems for point-buying your way to "balanced" abilities, but at the end of the day they all ended up being unbalanced in one way or another. After all, if you have an ability that gives you an extra d8 when you attack an undead enemy, how useful that ability is depends entirely on how often the GM pits you against undead enemies. If you have an ability to fly, how useful that ability is depends on how often you need to and couldn't otherwise.</p>
<p>Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities <em>as you go</em>. If an ability feels too strong? Give it an extra requirement, or make one of its requirements more costly! If an ability feels too weak? Give it an extra effect or strengthen one of its existing effects without requiring the character to upgrade it.</p>
