<p><strong>Special abilities</strong> are exactly what they sound like. They're your magic spells, martial art forms, animal transformations, or any other cool mechanic that's specific to your character. And best of all? You decide how they work.</p>
<h2 id="ability-points">Ability points<a class="headerlink" href="#ability-points" title="Copy link to header"></a></h2>
<p>To start with, consider what powers your character's special abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do? A special ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! </p>
<p>Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of <strong>ability points</strong>. You start with from 1 to 3 ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use special abilities, and you can recover spent points when you <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/#recovering">spend some downtime to recover</a>. </p>
<p>You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their <em>mana</em> from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their <em>ammunition</em> in an arsenal.  A leader might replenish their <em>pride</em> from cheering throngs of admirers.</p>
<h3 id="naming-and-renaming-ability-points">Naming and renaming ability points<a class="headerlink" href="#naming-and-renaming-ability-points" title="Copy link to header"></a></h3>
<p>If you're not sure what you want you want your ability points to be called at the start, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later. Eventually, though, you will want them to have a name because it helps to make the flavor of your character come to life!</p>
<p>Similarly, you should feel free to rename your ability points if the name you chose doesn't feel right or if it no longer makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-ability-points-and-creating-special-abilities">Gaining ability points and creating special abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#gaining-ability-points-and-creating-special-abilities" title="Copy link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Between sessions you can remove special abilities from your character sheet if you feel like they don't belong-- whether you just don't like how they work or if you feel like they don't make sense to your character anymore.</p>
<p>If you do, for each special ability you remove make sure you improve an existing ability or learn a new special ability to take its place. Remember, whenever you make new special abilities it's a good idea to make sure you take some time to talk them over with your table and/or your GM before you introduce them.</p>
<h3 id="special-abilities-from-basic-abilities">Special abilities from basic abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#special-abilities-from-basic-abilities" title="Copy link to header"></a></h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to create a special ability is to power up a <a href="../../gameplay/basic_abilities/">basic ability</a>. Here are some examples -- the specific ability points that power them are <em>italicized</em>.</p>
<h4 id="attack">Attack<a class="headerlink" href="#attack" title="Copy link to header"></a></h4>

<p><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> <strong>The Dead Speak to Me</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-abilities">New abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#new-abilities" title="Copy link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Another way to create special abilities is to make entirely new abilities! Special abilities can do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway.</p>
<p>If a special ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a <a href="../../gameplay/tests/">test</a> to resist the effects, setting the <strong>Difficulty</strong> (likely based on your roll or one of your passive attributes) and describing what happens if they <strong>Critically Succeed</strong>, <strong>Succeed</strong>, <strong>Partially Succeed</strong>, or <strong>Fail</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="heal-somebody">Heal somebody<a class="headerlink" href="#heal-somebody" title="Copy link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Test a specific attribute, then heal damage from someone <a href="../../getting_started/#range-and-spaces">close</a> equal to what you rolled.  If you roll higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa-solid fa-medkit"></i> <strong>Medic Matrix</strong></p>
<p>As an action by spending 1 <em>nyanobot</em>, test your knowledge to heal that much damage from someone close. If you rolled higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="move-an-enemy">Move an enemy<a class="headerlink" href="#move-an-enemy" title="Copy link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Test a specific attribute against an enemy's passive attributes, then move them if you win!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class ="ra ra-meat-hook"></i><strong>Grapple Gun</strong></p>
<p>As an action, fire your grappling hook arm at an enemy within long range to pull them in closer. Test your brawn against their passive brawn or agility. If you succeed, pull them a short distance toward you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="tag-something">Tag something<a class="headerlink" href="#tag-something" title="Copy link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Give yourself a tagged item for the scene, or tag parts of yourself as if they were an item. Automatically add the +1 tag at level 2, +2 at level 3, and so on up to +9 at level 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="ra ra-anvil"></i> <strong>Rockin' Abs</strong></p>
<p>Once per rest as a reaction, you can spend 1 <em>muscle point</em> to treat your 6 pack as if it was an item with the <em>brawn</em> and <em>armor</em> tags for the scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="upgrading-special-abilities">Upgrading special abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-special-abilities" title="Copy link to header"></a></h2>
<p>As you get stronger, so should your special abilities! When you upgrade your special abilities, usually you're looking to either <strong>give them an extra effect</strong> or <strong>make them stronger</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="combine-basic-abilities">Combine basic abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#combine-basic-abilities" title="Copy link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. One way to accomplish that is by combining the effects of two basic abilities into one special ability!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> <strong>I Know the Supernatural</strong></p>
<p>As an action, by spending 1 <em>firsthand supernatural experience</em> I can roll Knowledge to <strong>Get Answers</strong> about a supernatural creature I can see. Before I roll, I can trade one of my d12s for a d20.</p>

<p>Your combined special ability will usually still require you to spend the same number of total actions, but now that they are one roll both benefit from any strengthening upgrades you provide.</p>
<p>You can also combine already upgraded special abilities!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="ra ra-sword"></i> <strong>Divine Weapon</strong></p>
<p>As an action, by spending 1 <em>faith</em> I can give anything the <em>+5</em>, <em>blessed</em>, <em>will</em>, and <em>weapon</em> tags.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i class="ra ra-sword"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-medkit"></i> <strong>Blessing of the Golden Ankh</strong></p>
<p>As two actions, by spending 1 <em>faith</em> I can roll Will to heal somebody by the amount I rolled. In addition, give something equipped to them the <em>+5</em>, <em>blessed</em>, <em>will</em>, and <em>weapon</em> tags.</p>

<p>If you want a special ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. </p>
<p>One way is to trade a d12 for a d20, or increasing the number of d12s are traded into d20s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="ra ra-diamonds-card"></i> <strong>Mechanisms are My Forte</strong></p>
<p>By spending 1 <em>sprocket</em> before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade a d12 to a d20 before rolling.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="arrow-block"><span class="arrow-block-text">Upgrade</span></div>

<p><i class="ra ra-diamonds-card"></i> <strong>Mechanisms are My Forte +</strong></p>
<p>By spending 1 <em>sprocket</em> before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade two d12s to d20s before rolling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way is by adding additional tags, or increasing the magnitude of those tags!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> <strong>Fireball</strong></p>
<p>As an action, you can spend 1 <em>mp</em> to make an <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> Attack with Knowledge against a target within <em>long range</em> and all targets within <em>short range</em> of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="arrow-block"><span class="arrow-block-text">Upgrade</span></div>

<p><i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> <strong>Firestorm</strong></p>
<p>As an action, you can spend 1 <em>mp</em> to make an <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> Attack with Knowledge against a target within <em>long range</em> and all targets within <em>medium range</em> of them.</p>

<p>Most special abilities are going to be the kind you see above, but sometimes you just want to go <em>bigger</em> to summon a meteor storm or telekinetically pull a starship down from the sky. For these sorts of special abilities, talk with your GM. It's possible that what you're really trying to do is to <a href="../../gameplay/basic_abilities/#make-progress-on-something-big"><i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> Make Progress on something big</a>. </p>
<p>If you and your GM agree that this is something you should have on your character sheet, then you should pick a way to earn it. Maybe you need to develop the special ability as something smaller, and then get the big version after you've upgraded it a certain number of times. Maybe the special ability costs more points of potential than a regular one.</p>
<p>Finally, special abilities get bigger and badder the more requirements you put on them. If you want a really big special ability, you should attach some pretty serious requirements. Most of the time, this is at least spending downtime to ready the big special ability for action. Review <a href="../../running_the_game/creating_abilities/#requirements">requirements</a> with your GM and pick some that make sense!</p>
