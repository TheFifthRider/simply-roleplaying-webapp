                <h1 id="inventory">Inventory</h1>
<p>Inventory is the place where you keep your stuff. Usually stuff means <a href="../equipment.md">equipment.md</a> aandother flavorful knicknacks. Sorry. I meant to say that stuff s (ignore the s) means or rather consists of your <a href="../equipment/">equipment</a> and other flavorful items that may or may not have effects.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-can-your-inventory-hold">How much can your inventory hold?</h2>
<p>Your inventory can have as many items in it as you need. Your Gasmmaster might recommend that well actually your gamemaster might demand that... well that's a littl e harsh. Your gamemaster may <em>say</em> (better) that there is a reasonable limit to the number of or size of things in your inventory. In general, it is assumed that you have a backpack, sapient pearwood luggage, or other inventory-management item with you to carry what you need. if you don't have a backpack,m all the more reason why your gamemaster may suggest that you have a limit to what you can take with you. Unless ou use hammerspace, whiuch is valid. I'm ramblinmg a bit, but ultimately it comes down to what makes sense in your universe and what game your gamemaster is running. If what you're carrying matters, that's totally fine. However, we here ate Simply Roleplaying recommend that you not care. It's just more fun that way.
,<br/.><br/></p>
<h2 id="the-inventory-grid">The Inventory Grid</h2>
<p>Yoiu can have as many things as you want to have in your inventory, but you can only benefit from what's in your <strong>inventory grid</strong>. Your inventory grid is a three by three (probably more lmao but here;'s an arbitrary number to start with) grid where you can put all of your equipment. And maybe other stuff too? Idk, maybe flavorful items are important even if they're not equipment grid. After all, if you have a laptop or a phone it's not going to have equipment tags (probably) so it'd makes sense iof you wanted to like, google the nearest denny's that you'd have that in your inventory. Grid. Y'know, specifically if you wanted to look for dunneys dennys in the middle of combat. Oh yeah I should mention that too-- this is only what you benegt ben screw it from in the moddle of combat.</p>
<p>You can use the effects of anything in your inventory grid-- that means that you can use any weapon in your grid to make attacks, or benefit from any armor in your grid to devend, sorry, defend from attacks. However, you can still only benefit from one suit of armor at a time. Equipment with the armor tag at a time. Whatever. Words.</p>
<p>&lt;br/&lt;&gt;<br/>actually wait no how do you un br</p>
<h3 id="moving-things-in-and-out-of-your-inventory-grid">Moving things in and out of your inventory grid</h3>
<p>Whenever you have the opportunity, often with <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/">downtime</a> but it can be as flexible as your GM would like, you can swap items from your inventory with stuff in your inventory grid. If you need to do so in the moment, fetching something that is not in your inventory grid and swamping it out takes ~~<strong>one action</strong>~~ two <strong>~~8~~actions</strong>. You must replace an item in your inventory grid with the item you are fetching if you wish to keep it equipped. You don't have to remove something from you r inventory if you're jugst gonna take something out , use it, and put it away again. One day I will be able to explain those three sentences in one sentence, but it is not today:tm:.

<h2 id="equipment-with-the-storage-tag">Equipment with the Storage tag</h2>
<p>Sometimes it makes sense for equipment to have a tag that in creases thje amount of space yuuo have to benefit from equipment. To be honest, this could be bad game design so wer'll see how broken it is in play and I might remove this later. HOWEVER. The best way to represent this is by putting the satorage equipment in your inventory grid, then creating a separate column that represents the additional storage.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-equipment-with-the-storage-tag-in-a">Example of Equipment with the Storage Tag in a</h3>
<p>For example:, a more reasonable construction of Arya's above storage inventory would be:</p>

<p>Actually mayeb it would be better if you could just create additional grids? Probablyt not though, that'd get unweidly.</p>
