                <h1 id="items-and-inventory">Items and Inventory</h1>
<p>Your <strong>items</strong> are your stuff. They go in your <strong>inventory</strong>. Playing cards, bundles of rope, your trusty blade-- it might be equipment with tags to describe its use, or it might simply be a flavorful item that may or may not have specifically codified effects.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-can-your-inventory-hold">How much can your inventory hold?</h2>
<p>There's not a strict limit to what you can have in your inventory-- your inventory should be able to hold everything you need, but it probably should still <a href="../../getting_started/dice/#narrative-truth">make sense</a>. Unless your setting calls for a reason otherwise, it's generally assumed that you have a backpack, sapient pearwood luggage, or other inventory-management item with you to carry what you need. When in doubt, it's practical to not limit what can be in someone's inventory. Nobody wants to deal with explaining how exactly they're carrying twelve different swords in their backpack.</p>
<h2 id="equipped-items">Equipped Items</h2>
<p>You can have as many things as you want to have in your inventory, but you can only benefit from what's <strong>equipped</strong>. Equipped items are things you're wearing, holding, have on your belt-- anything that you know exactly where it is and can grab it immediately in a pinch. Just like what's in your inventory, what you have equipped should <a href="../../getting_started/dice/#narrative-truth">make sense</a>. Whenever you have the opportunity, often with <a href="../../gameplay/downtime/">downtime</a> but it can be as flexible as your GM would like, you can equip and unequip items.</p>
<p>When you're in an <a href="../../gameplay/action/">action scenario</a> you can use anything you have equipped without taking any time to pull it out or put it away. If they're not equipped, then you'll have to take <strong>at least one action</strong> to retrieve the items and equip them first. Your GM may say you must use multiple actions if you're trying to get out a lot of things, what you're trying to get needs assembly after being retrieved, or what you're getting is particularly difficult to get out of your portable storage. You can unequip any items necessary for what you have equipped to still <a href="../../getting_started/dice/#narrative-truth">make sense</a> as a part of these actions.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you wish to stow items for any reason in an <a href="../../gameplay/action/">action scenario</a> you can take <strong>at least one action</strong> to unequip them into your inventory. Just like with equipping, if it's something cumbersome or something that requires disassembly before storage your GM may say you must use multiple actions for this.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<p>Equipment are the tools you wear or use to accomplish tasks-- your armor, weapons, magic staves, and lockpick set. Equipment might be protective, weaponized, or useful in some other way. <strong>Tags</strong> describe what's important about the equipment: how it can be used, what benefits it provides, and anything else that matters. You can only benefit from <strong>equipment</strong> if they're equipped.</p>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p>Here's a suggested list of tags that you can use to describe the equipment in your game. Be sure to add more tags that are important to your setting! If you're in a dark fantasy setting hunting beasts of the night and need silvered weapons to confront them, <em>silver</em> should be a tag. If you're in a futuristic dystopian setting and everything legally acquired is monitored through a chip, <em>unchipped</em> should be a tag.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, <strong>tag things when they need to be tagged</strong>. An iron sword doesn't need to be tagged with <em>iron</em> when an adventurer picks it up, but the instant they start a plot thread of investigating something that's vulnerable to cold iron, it should be.</p>
<h4 id="1-2-3">+1, +2, +3, ...</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag are more effective than other equipment of the same type due to exemplary craftsmanship, materials, and/or renown. Add the tagged number to any test of ability you make with this equipment. If the equipment's tags grant a bonus or number (such as Armor Value) separate from tests of abilities, add the tagged amount.</p>
<h4 id="extranormal-power">&lt; Extranormal Power &gt;</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag is infused with a particular type of <a href="../../extras/powers/">extranormal power</a>, augmenting its functionality.</p>
<h4 id="agility">Agility</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag make is often light, compact, or relies on manual precision to operate effectively. <em>Bows</em>, <em>scimitars</em>, <em>sniper rifles</em>, and <em>pistols</em> often have the Agility tag.</p>

<p><em>requires: any attribute tag</em></p>
<p>Equipment with this tag are wearable defense like personal shield generators, Kevlar vests, or full plate. When worn, armor grants the wearer with <strong>armor value</strong> equal to <strong>the highest passive value of the equipment's tagged attributes</strong>. A character can only benefit from one set of armor at a time.</p>
<h4 id="battering">Battering</h4>
<p>Weapons with this tag are blunt instruments that rely on their weight to deal damage. <em>Batons</em>, <em>maces</em>, and <em>war picks</em> often have the Battering tag.</p>
<h4 id="brawn">Brawn</h4>

<h4 id="concealable">Concealable</h4>

<h4 id="focus">Focus</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag can be used to utilize the <a href="../../extras/powers/">extranormal powers</a> that this weapon is tagged with.</p>
<h4 id="hooking">Hooking</h4>
<p>Weapons with this tag have curved blades that allow their wielder to hook onto their opponents. <em>Khopeshes</em>, <em>scythes</em>, and <em>sickles</em> often have the Hooking tag.</p>
<h4 id="impaling">Impaling</h4>
<p>Weapons with this tag have a sharp point that is stabbed at opponents. <em>Bayonets</em>, <em>rapiers</em>, and <em>spears</em> often have the Impaling tag.</p>
<h4 id="intuition">Intuition</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag is often foreign or complicated in inconsistent ways, requiring keen adaptability to operate effectively. <em>Alien technology</em> and <em>mental magic catalysts</em> often have the Intuition tag.</p>
<h4 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag is often complicated and only able to be effectively operated by someone thoroughly trained in how it works. <em>Mad science gadgets</em>, <em>ancient rituals</em>, and <em>physical magic catalysts</em> often have the Knowledge tag.</p>
<h4 id="large">Large</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag requires two hands to wield effectively. <em>Rocket launchers</em>, <em>mauls</em>, <em>longbows</em>, and <em>staves</em> often have the Large tag.</p>
<h4 id="long-range">Long-range</h4>

<h4 id="precision">Precision</h4>
<p>Weapons with this tag fire a swift shot that is deadly when placed perfectly. <em>Crossbows</em>, <em>semi-automatic rifles</em>, and <em>slings</em> often have the Precision tag.</p>
<h4 id="presence">Presence</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag might be sentient and require reasoning with to operate effectively or otherwise somehow utilize the wielder's social aptitudes. <em>A high maintenance combat support robot</em>, <em>a tape recording of the maddening snores of C'thulhu</em>, or <em>an arcane book of physically manifesting insults</em> might have the Presence tag.</p>
<h4 id="repeating">Repeating</h4>
<p>Weapons in this tag fire a number of projectiles in rapid succession, bombarding their target. <em>Automatic rifles</em>, <em>hwachas</em>, and <em>???</em> often have the Repeating tag.</p>
<h4 id="shield">Shield</h4>
<p>Equipment with this tag are carriable defense, like bucklers, directional forcefields, and riot shields. When carried, shields <strong>increase the character's armor value by 5</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="will">Will</h4>
