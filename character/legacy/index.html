<blockquote>
<p>:warning: This page is a Work in Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Legacies are a testament to what you've done to shape the world and who you know. Like <a href="../skills/">skills and backgrounds</a> legacies can make it easier to accomplish <a href="../../gameplay/tests/">tests</a> by granting you bonus dice where the legacy holds sway and legacies are also a source of <a href="../../getting_started/dice/#narrative-truth">narrative truth</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-legacy">What is a Legacy?</h2>
<p>Legacies can be...</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>position of authority</strong> over people in a community, and they have some kind of title to reflect it. 
    <em>Captain of the Whitehall Militia</em>, <!-- more examples -->. </li>
<li><strong>Contacts</strong> that you have; people or factions that look out for you. 
    <em>Protected by the Thieves' Guild</em>, <em>Citizen of the Allied Worlds</em>, <em>Friend of the Mini-taur</em> <!-- more examples -->. </li>
<li>A <strong>reputation</strong> you've earned
    <em>Fang of the Fringe</em>, <em>I've Stolen More Than I've Bought</em>, <!-- more examples --></li>
<li>An <strong>obligation</strong> you must fulfil
    <em>Pilgrim of the Four Elements</em></li>
<li>An <strong>enemy</strong> you have
    <em>Hunted by the Iron Herald</em> <!-- more examples --></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-legacy-do">What does a Legacy do?</h2>
<p>Legacies can be added to <a href="../../gameplay/tests/">tests of ability</a> like skills and backgrounds.</p>
<p>Legacies are also a source of <a href="../../getting_started/dice/#narrative-truth">narrative truth</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="earning-legacies">Earning Legacies</h2>
<p>Legacies are earned at character creation, and any time after that it makes sense for them to be earned.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Legacies are a way of giving a character's past a meaningful impact on their present as a series of benefits and detriments. Legacies can take many forms, though usually they are one of the following.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="authority">Authority</h2>
<p>A character with an Authority legacy has some form of authority over people within a community. A rank 1 authority legacy holds a small amount of sway-- the position might not be influential, the community might be small, or the community might be disconnected from the rest of the world. A rank 3 authority legacy, on the other hand, would give the character who has it significant clout.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="contacts">Contacts</h2>
<p>Contacts represent groups or people looking out for you. Contacts worth 1 point are typically friendly towards the character, but will not go out of their way for the character's happiness- though they may reduce prices and the like. Contacts worth 2 points will fight for the character, but if the going gets tough they will retreat, as their own survival is more important to them. Contacts worth 3 points, however, will put their life on the line for the character. Contacts worth 4 points are fairly powerful and seek to protect the character, even at the cost of their own life. Contacts worth 5 points are obscenely powerful and will always protect the character, if able.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="reputation">Reputation</h2>
<p>A character with a Reputation legacy has done something, and they're known for it. Reputation worth 1 point is either localized or renowned for a minor act, while fame worth 3 points tends to be for a major, widely renowned act. If people sympathize with your situation, having a reputation can get you lots of things: willing aid despite the law, deals on gear, free food and shelter, and any other way that folks might help you out. On the other hand, a reputation can mean infamy. Being known as a criminal might get you access to the best fences in town, but it'll also paint a target on your back with the local watch.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="obligation">Obligation</h2>
<p>A character with an Obligation disadvantage has some form of Obligation to another character or group of characters which they must fulfil. Generally, a character with an Obligation worth 1 points has a short term and unimportant task or responsibility that they are obligated to do. A character with an Obligation worth  2 points has either a long term or important task or responsibility that they are obligated to do. A character with an Obligation worth 3 points has an obligation that is both long term and important. For Obligations above 3, the Obligation is important and also magically or mentally reinforced to such a degree that the character would receive massive repercussions should they not perform the Obligation. For an Obligation worth 4, the character may be forced to perform the task/take on the responsibility regardless of their moral or mental capacities, but have a certain level at which they can resist it, but for an Obligation worth 5, what they are Obligated to do is completely irrefutable. Your GM may alter the amount of points this disadvantage is worth depending on the difficulty of the Obligation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="enemy">Enemy</h2>
<p>Somewhere along the line, a character with an Enemy disadvantage made an enemy, and that enemy will likely show up to confront the character multiple times during the RP. A character with an enemy worth 1 point generally has someone who sees the character as their rival and wishes to beat them, but otherwise doesn't seek them much harm. A character with an enemy worth 2 points generally has their enemy constantly showing up to thwart their plans. It's unlikely that a 2 point Enemy would want to kill the character, however, as they have much more fun watching their plans fall apart. An enemy worth 3 points is out for blood, and will stop at nothing to try to kill the character. An enemy worth 4 points is some form of very powerful enemy that wants the character's head. An enemy worth 5 points is obscenely powerful and wants to kill the character. Due to the nature of an enemy of worth three and above, the character will likely flee from them until they are powerful enough to face them.</p>
