<blockquote>
<p>:warning: This page is a Work in Progress</p>

<p>Advantages and Disadvantages are a way of giving a character's past a meaningful impact on their present by describing their past circumstances and the consequences of their past actions as a series of benefits and detriments. A character can have any number of the same type of advantage or disadvantage, as long as the content of those advantages or disadvantages do not overlap. For instance, Jordan's character cannot have an Infamy disadvantage for murdering a popular duke, and also have a Major Secret disadvantage for murdering that same duke. However, Jordan's character could have two Major Secret disadvantages, one for murdering a popular duke and another for stealing a king's fortune.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="the-advantages">The Advantages</h2>
<h3 id="authority">Authority</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>A character with an Authority advantage has some form of authority over people within their race or community. A character with an Authority worth 1 point typically either holds a minor role within their race or a major role within a small community. A character with an Authority worth 2 points usually either has a moderate role within their race or a major role within a moderately sized community. A character with an Authority worth 3 points typically holds is a major role within their race.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="contacts">Contacts</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 5</em></p>
<p>A character with a Contacts advantage has some kind of group or person looking after them and concerned for their well-being. Contacts worth 1 point are typically friendly towards the character, but will not go out of their way for the character's happiness- though they may reduce prices and the like. Contacts worth 2 points will fight for the character, but if the going gets tough they will retreat, as their own survival is more important to them. Contacts worth 3 points, however, will put their life on the line for the character. Contacts worth 4 points are fairly powerful and seek to protect the character, even at the cost of their own life. Contacts worth 5 points are obscenely powerful and will always protect the character, if able.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="cultured">Cultured</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1</em></p>
<p>A character who has the Cultured advantage is very knowledgeable about a specific culture such that they might know many unusual facts about them. A character with the Cultured advantage typically knows enough about the culture that they always observe the correct customs and get along well with members of that culture.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 5</em> </p>
<p>A character with an Equipment advantage has procured a piece of equipment from a previous adventure, as a family heirloom, or something else of that nature. An Equipment worth 1 point is typically ordinary or not very useful. An Equipment worth 2 points is a well crafted piece or somehow uncommon. An Equipment worth 3 points is unique or particularly rare. Equipment worth 4 points is particularly unique or powerful, and Equipment worth 5 points is something that could only ever be acquired by the character, and is abundantly powerful. Any Equipment worth 4 points and above hold a precious place in its owner's heart, making it nearly impossible to be lost by the owner. In campaigns where magic is present, Equipment of this rank or higher often are magically tethered to their owner, and cannot be moved any more than a small distance away from them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="natural-equipment">Natural Equipment</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 5</em> </p>
<p>The Natural Equipment advantage is similar to the Equipment advantage, but instead of procuring equipment, the character with the Natural Equipment advantage is bestowed with some form of equipment that is built into their body. Claws, wings, and gills are all prime examples of natural equipment. This convenience comes at a cost, however, as most characters with Natural Equipment require specially crafted armor to enable them to use their natural equipment without it being obstructed. A Natural Equipment rank 1 is mostly cosmetic, with only limited application in the character's day-to-day life. A Natural Equipment rank 3 has the equivalent functionality of a piece of equipment that could be bought or manufactured. A natural equipment rank 5 is highly unique to the character, and features prominently in the character's day-to-day life.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="extranormal-sense">Extranormal Sense</h3>
<p><em>Rank 2 - 3</em></p>
<p>The Extranormal Sense advantage is either major or minor. A major Extranormal Sense is worth 3 points and grants a quasi-magical form of a sense, such as the ability to see using the grounds reverberations or x-ray vision. A minor Extranormal Sense is worth 2 points and grants a more natural, but still impressive, enhancement to a sense, such as natural night vision or the ability to track using scent.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="fame">Fame</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>A character with a Fame advantage has performed some act of universal approval that has garnered them a positive reputation. A character with a Fame worth 1 point is surrounded by a general feeling of good will by most, if not all, when their true identity is revealed. A character with a Fame worth 2 points has performed some kind of minor act recognized everywhere, and will likely be recognized for their act via free meals and the like if their true identity is revealed. A character with a Fame worth 3 points has performed some kind of major service, and will most likely be protected from harm by the common people if their true identity is revealed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="form-alteration">Form Alteration</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>By use of the Form Alteration advantage, a character can magically shift their form into another form. A Form Alteration worth 1 point is typically a minor transformation, 2 points typically is a moderate transformation, and 3 points is a major transformation. If you are using the Earth: The Forgotten Times races,  regular Gauntians have Form Alteration worth 1 point, Nexagaunts, Vampires, Succubi, and dire Gauntians have Form Alteration worth 2 points and Faeries have Form Alteration worth 3 points.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="photographic-memory">Photographic Memory</h3>
<p><em>Rank 2</em></p>
<p>The Photographic Memory advantage is fairly simple; if the character with it has seen something, they can most likely recall it in details that others cannot easily.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="pet">Pet</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 5</em></p>
<p>The character has a pet! Simply put, the Pet advantage gives the character a pet that is worth an amount of points in proportion to how helpful their pet might be, where 1 is relatively unhelpful and 3 is very helpful. Pets that are worth 4 or more points are typically magical, in addition to being helpful.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="the-disadvantages">The Disadvantages</h2>
<h3 id="environmental-allergy">Environmental Allergy</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em> </p>
<p>A character with an Environmental Allergy disadvantage is allergic to something in their environment, like rust, pollen, sunlight, mold, or some other such environmental factor. Generally, a character with an Environmental Allergy worth 1 point is discomforted by the allergen, causing non-fatal damage and distraction. A character with an Environmental Allergy worth 2 points is generally incapacitated by being affected by their allergen, and a character with an Environmental Allergy worth 3 points will likely die if they come into contact with their allergen. Your GM may alter the amount of points this disadvantage is worth depending on the rarity of the allergen and the ease of treatment available.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="cultural-ignorance">Cultural Ignorance</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1</em></p>
<p>A character with a Cultural Ignorance disadvantage is not very knowledgeable about a specific culture (A culture is any of the main headings in the races page). Often, they unreasonably hate or fear that culture, due to warped truths that have been passed down through their family. They will be inclined to distrust members of this culture, as well as likely have racist sentiments regarding to that culture.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="obligation">Obligation</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 5</em></p>
<p>A character with an Obligation disadvantage has some form of Obligation to another character or group of characters which they must fulfil. Generally, a character with an Obligation worth 1 points has a short term and unimportant task or responsibility that they are obligated to do. A character with an Obligation worth  2 points has either a long term or important task or responsibility that they are obligated to do. A character with an Obligation worth 3 points has an obligation that is both long term and important. For Obligations above 3, the Obligation is important and also magically or mentally reinforced to such a degree that the character would receive massive repercussions should they not perform the Obligation. For an Obligation worth 4, the character may be forced to perform the task/take on the responsibility regardless of their moral or mental capacities, but have a certain level at which they can resist it, but for an Obligation worth 5, what they are Obligated to do is completely irrefutable. Your GM may alter the amount of points this disadvantage is worth depending on the difficulty of the Obligation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="enemy">Enemy</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 5</em></p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, a character with an Enemy disadvantage made an enemy, and that enemy will likely show up to confront the character multiple times during the RP. A character with an enemy worth 1 point generally has someone who sees the character as their rival and wishes to beat them, but otherwise doesn't seek them much harm. A character with an enemy worth 2 points generally has their enemy constantly showing up to thwart their plans. It's unlikely that a 2 point Enemy would want to kill the character, however, as they have much more fun watching their plans fall apart. An enemy worth 3 points is out for blood, and will stop at nothing to try to kill the character. An enemy worth 4 points is some form of very powerful enemy that wants the character's head. An enemy worth 5 points is obscenely powerful and wants to kill the character. Due to the nature of an enemy of worth three and above, the character will likely flee from them until they are powerful enough to face them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="infamy">Infamy</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>A character with an Infamy disadvantage has performed some act of universal despise that has garnered them a negative reputation. A character with an Infamy worth 1 point is surrounded by a general feeling of animosity by most, if not all, when their true identity is revealed. A character with an Infamy worth 2 points has committed some kind of minor atrocity recognized everywhere, and will likely be arrested if their true identity is revealed. A character with an Infamy worth 3 points has committed some kind of major atrocity, and will most likely be hunted down and killed if their true identity is revealed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="major-secret">Major Secret</h3>
<p><em>Rank 3</em></p>
<p>A character with a Major Secret disadvantage has something that must be hidden from the rest of their party members, and from everyone they meet. If their secret is revealed to any individual, they will likely constantly be paranoid about that character giving away their secret and will do anything in their power to keep the secret from getting out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="mental-disorder">Mental Disorder</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>A character with a Mental Disorder disadvantage has some form of mental ailment that plagues them. Generally, a Mental Disorder worth 1 point is a trivial mental disorder and a Mental Disorder worth 3 is a debilitating mental disorder. Some examples are: hoarding, being paranoid, being a kleptomaniac, having object attachment, compulsively lying, compulsively being honest, having obsessive compulsive disorder, having authority issues, and having pyromania. Your GM will dictate how much your Mental Disorder is worth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="dependency">Dependency</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>A character that has the Dependency disadvantage desires some specific thing whenever it is available. A character with a Dependency worth 1 has a strong desire to obtain what they are dependent on, and will seek it out at any given opportunity. A character with a Dependency worth 2 points has a compulsion to obtain what they are dependent on, and will seek it out even if forbidden to do so. A character with a Dependency worth 3 points requires what they are dependent on to live or function, and will attempt to gain hold of it by any means possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="phobia">Phobia</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>A character with a Phobia disadvantage is unreasonably afraid of something. A character with a Phobia worth 1 point generally has an extreme aversion to their phobia, and will trigger their innate fight or flight responses. A character with a Phobia worth 2 points will likely not willfully near phobia, and if confronted by it will always flee. A character with a Phobia worth 3 points typically becomes incapacitated or hostile to allies when confronted by their phobia.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="physical-disorder">Physical Disorder</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>A character with a Physical Disorder disadvantage has some form of physical ailment that plagues them. Generally, a Physical Disorder worth 1 point is a trivial physical disorder and a Physical Disorder worth 3 is a debilitating physical disorder. Some examples are: inappropriate expression, mysophobia, narcolepsy. Your GM will dictate how much your Physical Disorder is worth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="disfigurement">Disfigurement</h3>
<p><em>Rank 1 - 3</em></p>
<p>A character with the Disfigurement disadvantage has had a substantial amount of bodily harm inflicted upon them, so much so that it has left some lasting damage. A character with a Disfigurement worth 1 point probably has some major scarring. A character with a Disfigurement worth 2 points is somewhat functionally impaired in the affected area. A character with a Disfigurement worth 3 points typically is missing a reasonable chunk of their body, such as a loss of a limb.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="sense-impairment">Sense Impairment</h3>
<p><em>Rank 2 - 3</em> </p>
<p>A character with a Sense Impairment disadvantage can have it one of two ways; the Sense Impairment is either worth 3 points and representative of a loss of a sense (Blindness, deafness), or worth 2 points and is partial loss of a sense.</p>
