                <h1 id="about-simply-roleplaying">About Simply Roleplaying</h1>
<p>Simply Roleplaying started in 2013 at a friend's birthday party in college when somebody suggested I run a one-shot session. There were six players, ranging from experienced players to players who had only ever heard of roleplaying. At the time I was running two weekly D6 Fantasy campaigns and I was eager to play-- there was just one problem. I didn't have any of my D6 Fantasy materials. All I had was a single set of polyhedral dice.</p>
<p>So I winged it.</p>
<p>Every roleplaying system I had ever played had attributes and the d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 seemed like an easy way to rank strengths and weaknesses, so I decided on five attributes (Agility, Brawn, Mental, Charisma, and Luck) and had each player distribute the five dice between them. We streamlined character creation, I gave them a prompt for a one-shot that left their backstory a mystery with a hint of excitement, and we got to the business of playing the game.</p>
<p>The one-shot turned into a campaign and it became clear that the system worked for my players, but it needed to develop. As players asked me to do things and how to do things, I improvised ways it could be done and whatever worked, stuck. And so the system grew, piece by piece, based on what the players wanted or needed for the campaign.</p>
<p>The system as it is now is still a work in progress. I've been through many revisions, and there will likely be many more. But it was the simplicity of that first session that got it all started, and simplicity without losing nuance has been and will always be my guiding principle.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hey! I'm Richard. When I was younger, I loved to tinker with the rules for any board game I played, often before I had finished playing the game once and to the dismay of anyone I played with. When I joined my parents' AD&amp;D group, I started writing rule supplements for doing things that I thought would be cool, like overhauling the process for crafting and enchanting a weapon. They still play, by the way-- they made the switch to 5e a year or so after it got released.</p>
<p>I started putting pen to paper on my own games and systems in middle school. Any system I made was something that needed to be simple enough to be played on a whim at the lunch table or on a campout-- so that meant no dice or character sheets, let alone prep material. As a result, the systems I made were heavily narratively focused and had few mechanics beyond my players describing what they wanted to do and me improvising a world in response. In high school I built out a simple system with proper mechanics that was heavily inspired by Fire Emblem, and in college I started devouring other systems to learn from all the cool stuff that's out there!</p>
<p>Outside of roleplaying games, I dig video games and I have a rather sizeable collection of board games of which I'm proud to say there are only a few that I've never played. I also "spend a lot of time thinking about time" as my roommate puts it-- there's something about having a good todo list and time tracker going that just really helps me keep everything in my life running smoothly.</p>
