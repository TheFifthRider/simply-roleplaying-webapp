                <h1 id="basic-actions">Basic Actions</h1>
<p>Everybody can perform basic actions, but how they do them may look different depending on what way <a href="../getting_started/#narrative-truth">makes sense</a> for the character!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="attack">⚔Attack</h2>
<p>Attacking is a <a href="../tests/">test</a> of whatever attribute makes sense for the attack, usually against the roll of somebody who is defending against you! If your target cannot or does not defend, the difficulty is their passive brawn. If your target isn't a character and doesn't have passive brawn, you're actually probably <a href="#make-progress">making progress</a>.</p>
<p>When you make a test to <strong>attack someone</strong>, if you...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> Your target either takes half damage or no damage at all, depending on how well the defender rolled.</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong> Your target <a href="../../character/health/">takes damage</a> equal to your roll.</li>
<li><strong>Fully succeed:</strong> Your target <a href="../../character/health/">takes damage</a> equal to your roll.</li>
<li><strong>Critically Succeed:</strong>  Your target <a href="../../character/health/">takes damage</a> equal to twice your roll. </li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="defend">🛡 Defend</h2>
<p>If somebody attacks you, you can try to defend against the attack and turn it into a contest of their attack roll and whatever attribute you're defending with. You can also defend against an attack targeted at someone else as long as it <a href="../../getting_started/#narrative-truth">makes sense</a>, but you will take any damage they would have taken. </p>
<p>When you make a test to <strong>defend against an attack</strong>, If you...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> You take damage equal to the attacker's roll, or equal to double the attacker's roll depending on how well they rolled.</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong>  You take half of the attacker's roll as <a href="../../character/health/">damage</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Fully succeed:</strong> You take half of what the attacker rolled as <a href="../../character/health/">damage</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Critically succeed:</strong> You take no damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="get-answers">🔍Get Answers</h2>
<p>If you're trying to <strong>answers to questions</strong>, whether it's by researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual, make a <a href="../tests/">test</a> of the appropriate attribute and then ask the GM some questions.</p>
<p>When you make a test to <strong>find answers to questions</strong>, if you...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> You may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong> You may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully</li>
<li><strong>Succeed:</strong> You may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully</li>
<li><strong>Critically Succeed:</strong> You may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not sure what to ask, <strong>"What questions should I ask?"</strong> is always a good question. It counts towards the number of questions you get, but hones in on the juicy stuff your GM might have for you to discover. It's also realistic-- it's not often that a character knows what question they're trying to answer right when they start looking for information.</p>
<p>The answers to the questions should both make sense and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question <strong>"Who killed this person?"</strong> with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with <strong>"someone with red hair and a blue cloak"</strong> based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby.</p>
<p>Questions cannot be wasted. If the answer to a question was already stated, it doesn't count. If the answer to a question would not normally require a test to uncover, it doesn't count. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, it doesn't count and the person asked the question should explain why it is not answerable and how to make it answerable, if possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="help-hinder">🧱Help / Hinder</h2>
<p>If you want to help somebody out, get yourself into a better position, or hinder an enemy, you can do that by rolling and stacking or unstacking dice based on the result.</p>
<p>When you make a test to <strong>help or hinder someone</strong>, for every <strong>10</strong> in the total you rolled you may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack a die or in their favor</li>
<li>Remove a die stacked against them</li>
<li>Stack a die against them</li>
<li>Remove a die stacked in their favor</li>
</ul>
<p>The dice you stack depends on what level you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1-2</strong>: Stack d4s</li>
<li><strong>Level 3-4</strong>: Stack d6s</li>
<li><strong>Level 5-6</strong>: Stack d8s</li>
<li><strong>Level 7-8</strong>: Stack d10s</li>
<li><strong>Level 9+:</strong> Stack d12s</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="make-progress">⚙Make Progress</h2>
<p>If you're trying to do something and you can't do it in just one test, your GM may say that the goal of your test is to fill a <a href="../../running_the_game/creating_tests/#progress-meters">progress meter</a> in how close the task is to being done!</p>
<p>When you make a test to <strong>fill a progress meter</strong>, fill it by the amount that you rolled!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="prepare">🕓 Prepare</h2>
<p>When a character takes some downtime and makes a test of any attribute with a goal to <strong>prepare for a situation</strong>, stack a flashback die. Then, for every <strong>20</strong> in the total you rolled, you may stack another flashback die.</p>
<p>The dice you stack depends on what level you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1-2</strong>: Stack d4s</li>
<li><strong>Level 3-4</strong>: Stack d6s</li>
<li><strong>Level 5-6</strong>: Stack d8s</li>
<li><strong>Level 7-8</strong>: Stack d10s</li>
<li><strong>Level 9+:</strong> Stack d12s</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="sway-someone">💬 Sway Someone</h2>
<p>When you make a test to <strong>sway an NPC</strong> to do something, if you...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> They aren't convinced, and their opinion of you might suffer if you ask them again.</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong> If they can, they'll do specifically what you asked them to. If they can't, they'll tell you what, if anything, they need in order to do it.</li>
<li><strong>Fully succeed:</strong> If they can, they'll do what you need them to. If they can't, they'll tell you what, if anything, they need in order to do it.</li>
<li><strong>Critically succeed:</strong>  If they can, they'll go above and beyond to help out. If they can't, they'll tell you what, if anything, they need in order to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you make a test to <strong>sway another PC</strong> to do something, if you...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> They earn a point of Potential if they do the opposite of what you wanted.</li>
<li><strong>Succeed:</strong> They earn a point of Potential if they do what you wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="test-an-attribute">🃏 Test an Attribute</h2>
<p>When you make a test and none of the other basic moves make sense, if you...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> You don't get what you want and you might be in trouble.</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong> You get what you want, but there's a complication.</li>
<li><strong>Fully succeed:</strong> You get exactly what you want.</li>
<li><strong>Critically succeed:</strong> Not only do you get what you want, you get something extra!</li>
