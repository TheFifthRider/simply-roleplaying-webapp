<p>A warlord swings his mighty maul, bending metal and breaking bones. A medic presses the defibrillator to a fallen comrade's chest, returning the spark of life. A single captain stands tall brandishing a tattered flag, inspiring the defenders to fight on. Roleplaying is full of heroic moments when the action gets fierce. The Simply Combat Techniques module gives each weapon their own unique abilities in combat, so heroes and villains can inspire these moments that much more often.</p>
<h2 id="melee-weapons">Melee Weapons</h2>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<h4 id="aimed-strike">Aimed Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (1 ep)</strong><br />
Swing your weapon towards a specific area on your target's body to cripple them. Make an attack and specify a location on your target to aim for. If you hit the target and roll sufficiently high enough to hit the location you chose, inflict some kind of detriment to them based on the area hit. If they were holding something and you hit their hand, they will likely drop it. If they were running and you hit their legs, they will likely fall. A latch mechanism that you hit could cause a trap to spring. Your gamemaster will determine the final outcome of a successful Aimed Strike.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your accuracy increases. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Accuracy check for this attack.</p>
<h4 id="brutal-strike">Brutal Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (2 ep)</strong><br />
Use your tremendous strength to bring down a swift and nigh-inescapable blow. Perform an attack, but only make a Potency check instead of an Accuracy check and Potency check. When determining weapon accuracy, use your Potency roll as if it were the result of your Accuracy check.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your blow becomes even more vicious. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Potency check for this attack.</p>
<h4 id="concealed-strike">Concealed Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (2 ep)</strong><br />
Strike a target when they least expect it. Perform an attack but make a Stealth (Agility) check instead of an Accuracy check and Potency check. Treat your target's Awareness as the result of their Dodge roll for this attack, and the result of your Stealth roll as the result of your Accuracy and Potency checks for this attack.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your strike becomes capable of silently eliminating a foe. You may choose one of the following enhancements for each rank (you may choose the same enhancement more than once):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your attack is well hidden, only your target is aware that you attacked at all. Additionally, if your strike kills your target, they die without a struggle. Even to close observers it appears as though they simply lost consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may Max an additional skill die when performing your Stealth check</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="surgical-strike">Surgical Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (2 ep)</strong><br />
Use your expert precision to attack where the target's defenses are weakest. Perform an attack, but only make an Accuracy check instead of an Accuracy check and Potency check. When determining weapon damage, use your Accuracy roll as if it was the result of your Potency roll.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your strike becomes even more precise. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Accuracy check for this attack.</p>
<h4 id="charge">Charge</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (2 ep)</strong><br />
Rush forward and use your momentum to strike at a target. Move in a straight line up to your movement speed, then perform an attack.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your charge is significantly more flexible and powerful. You may choose one of the following enhancements for each rank:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may move past your target if you have not moved your full movement speed, regardless of if you hit your target or not. For this attack, you may treat any enemy along the line you charged as within melee range of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may carry your target with you if you hit with this attack and have not moved your full movement speed. If you collide with obstructions along this path, your target suffers an additional blow as if from an improvised weapon of the appropriate size of the obstruction, using your potency roll from this attack to determine the damage of the improvised weapon. You may continue to carry your target past each obstruction, provided you break through them or are able to knock them out of the way, until you have encountered a number of obstructions greater than the number of times you have chosen this enhancement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="grappletackle">Grapple/Tackle</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (1 ep)</strong><br />
Grab an enemy and restrain them, restricting their movement and removing their ability to dodge. Have a Grapple (Brawn) contest with your target. If you have used your minor action to move toward your intended target this turn, you may instead tackle them and max one of your dice when performing your Grapple check, but must take a minor action on your following turn to get back up. If you are successful, your target is prevented from using any major or minor actions that require movement and skip their next turn. Additionally, you move at half speed and must min your stat die (or dice) on any skill check that requires movement. On their turn, your target may take a major action to perform a Grapple contest with you. If they are successful, they free themselves. If they are unsuccessful, they gain a +1 bonus to subsequent attempts against this Grapple.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your grapple is significantly more powerful and less limiting. You may choose one of the following enhancements for each rank (you may choose the same enhancement more than once):</p>
<ul>
<li>You move at full speed while grappling an opponent and tackling an opponent does not require you to take a minor action to get back up</li>
<li>You may perform skill checks as normally if they require movement while Grappling an opponent</li>
<li>Max one of your dice when making Grapple checks related to this Grapple attempt.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="single-melee-weapon">Single Melee Weapon</h3>
<h4 id="cleave">Cleave</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (4 ep)</strong><br />
Swing your weapon in a wide arc, striking additional targets. Perform an attack and you may choose to attack up to two other targets within melee range of you. When you roll accuracy for this attack, each of the targets must roll dodge separately. Each of the targets that you hit are affected similarly by your potency roll.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your arc can encompass more foes. For each rank, you may attack up to two other targets within melee range of you.</p>
<h3 id="dual-wielding-same-size">Dual Wielding: Same Size</h3>
<h4 id="feint">Feint</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (1 ep)</strong><br />
Use two attacks to perform a devastating feint and secure a hit. Perform an attack. For that attack, you may min any number of your accuracy skill dice. After resolving that attack, perform another attack. When rolling accuracy for the second attack, max a number of accuracy skill dice equal to the number of accuracy dice you minned on the first attack.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your weapons dance in deadly patterns that hint at feints but still connect. For each rank, you may max an additional skill die more on the second attack than you minned on the first attack. You still receive the bonus from this enhancement even if you min 0 dice.</p>
<h3 id="dual-wielding-same-style">Dual Wielding: Same Style</h3>
<h4 id="mirrored-strike">Mirrored Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (1 ep)</strong><br />
Attack in such a way as to enable the use of your other weapon to make a second attack. When determining if you may perform a combo attack after this attack using your other weapon, you may treat one of your accuracy dice as if it was maxed. You may do this regardless of whether you hit your target.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, you are almost guaranteed a follow up attack. Max all of your accuracy dice instead of just one.</p>
<h3 id="small-melee">Small Melee</h3>
<h4 id="vital-strike">Vital Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (2 ep)</strong><br />
Slip your weapon past your target's defenses to strike them where they're weakest. Perform an attack. For that attack, treat Weak hits as if they were Medium hits and Medium hits as if they were Strong hits.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, you become more lethal with your strikes. For each rank, you may choose one of the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat all hits as if they were Strong hits.</li>
<li>When rolling accuracy if your attack would allow you to perform a combo attack you may instead double the damage of this hit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="medium-melee">Medium Melee</h3>
<h4 id="balanced-strike">Balanced Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (2 ep)</strong><br />
Swing your weapon with practiced coordination, utilizing the balance of speed and distance that your weapon affords you to strike a deadly blow. For this attack, you may choose to max one skill die on either your potency or accuracy roll.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, you are able to truly utilize the balance of your weapon. For each rank, you may max an additional skill die on either potency or accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="large-melee">Large Melee</h3>
<h4 id="intercepting-strike">Intercepting Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Reaction (2 ep)</strong><br />
Use the length of your weapon to tear apart your target before they can reach you. When an enemy takes a movement action that brings them within melee range of you at any point, you may perform this technique to stop them from moving and attack them. If your attack fails to hit, they may continue their movement action as normal.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, you are able to use the length of your weapon to greater effect. For each rank, you may choose one of the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your melee range is increased by 2m for the purposes of this technique. Additionally, if you perform this technique and fail to hit, your target must continue their movement action at half speed.</li>
<li>Your target must dodge carefully to avoid your attack. On this attack they must min their stat die (or dice) when rolling to evade. Additionally, until their next turn they must min half of their skill dice on any movement based skill attempt.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="battering-style">Battering Style</h3>
<h4 id="stunning-blow">Stunning Blow</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (3 ep)</strong><br />
Bash an enemy with your blunt instrument to stun and disorient them. For this attack, if you inflict damage on the target they must min every stat die when making skill checks until the end of their next turn.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, the inflicted stun is far more potent. For each rank, you may choose one of the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Record your potency roll for this attack. An enemy stunned by this attack must make an effort to even act. On each turn that the target remains stunned, they must make an Endurance check with a difficulty equivalent to your Potency roll for this attack. If they fail, they may not take any major actions on that turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The duration of the debuff increases by one turn. Further uses of this technique (with or without this enhancement) on a target where this debuff is active will refresh the duration. You may only choose this enhancement a maximum of two times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cleaving-style">Cleaving Style</h3>
<h4 id="splitting-strike">Splitting Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (3 ep)</strong><br />
Drive your weapon like a wedge through your target's defenses. Record the amount of damage you deal with this attack. On this attack, after inflicting damage, the target's armor value is temporarily reduced by the amount of damage you dealt until the beginning of your next turn. In the event of multiple sources applying this debuff, the target's armor value will only be reduced by the highest value applied.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, you are more adept at splitting even the toughest armors. For each rank, you may choose one of the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Armor value reduction from this technique lasts for one additional round. Further uses of this technique (with or without this enhancement) on a target where this debuff is active will refresh the duration and replace the armor value reduction if the damage that was subsequently dealt is higher. If you choose this enhancement two times, the debuff becomes permanent until repaired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The debuff applied by this technique can be applied on top of another instance of the debuff, to a maximum of two of these debuffs being active at the same time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hooking-style">Hooking Style</h3>
<h4 id="tearing-strike">Tearing Strike</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (3 ep)</strong><br />
Tear away enemy's weapons or defenses with the hook of your weapon. For this attack, if you hit, have a brawn contest with your target using this weapon's potency skill. If you win the contest, choose an item your target is carrying in their hands or an accessory that they are wearing. You tear the item away from them and may place it anywhere up to 1m away. The item is dropped before calculating damage.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, you are able to master the benefits of your hooked weapon. For each rank, you may choose one of the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may max an additional skill die for your potency roll to tear away the item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you successfully tear away an enemy item with this technique, you may equip it immediately (if able). In addition, your attack range increases by 2m for this attack and if you deal damage to your target you can drag them 2m closer to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slashing-style">Slashing Style</h3>
<h4 id="lacerate">Lacerate</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (3 ep)</strong><br />
Use the long edge of your blade to lacerate an enemy and afflict a wide, lasting wound. For this attack you cannot be outmaneuvered by the defender, though you can still miss. In addition, a target dealt damage by this attack becomes lacerated until healed. The next successful attack on a lacerated target deals bonus damage equal to a weak hit with the weapon used for this technique. After taking the bonus damage, the target is no longer considered lacerated.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your lacerations become more skillfully placed and deadly. For each rank, you may choose one of the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A lacerated target dealt damage by the attack becomes severely lacerated until healed. The next successful attack on a severely lacerated target deals bonus damage equal to a medium hit with the weapon used for this technique. After taking the bonus damage, the target is no longer considered severely lacerated. A target that is both severely lacerated and lacerated will take bonus damage as though only severely lacerated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A target considered lacerated or severely lacerated by this technique remains lacerated or severely lacerated for an additional instance of bonus damage. You may only choose this enhancement a maximum of two times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="impaling-style">Impaling Style</h3>
<h4 id="skewer">Skewer</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (3 ep)</strong><br />
Run enemy through with your weapon to deal massive damage. For this attack, your weapon damage is increased. A target dealt damage by this attack takes bonus damage equal to a weak hit with the weapon used for this technique.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your strike lances through your foes with ever deadlier force. For each rank, you may choose one of the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An enemy dealt damage by this attack becomes grievously wounded until healed. Record your potency roll for this attack. A grievously wounded target cannot be healed unless the healer is able to overcome the severity of the wound, and rolls a higher number on their heal check than your recorded potency roll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your damage with this technique is dramatically increased. A target dealt damage by this attack takes bonus damage equal to a medium hit with the weapon used for this technique. If you choose this enhancement twice, this attack deals bonus damage equal to a Strong hit with the weapon used for this technique instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ranged-weapons">Ranged Weapons</h2>
<h3 id="general_1">General</h3>
<h4 id="aimed-shot">Aimed Shot</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (1 ep)</strong><br />
Aim your shot towards a specific area on your target's body to cripple them. When making this attack, specify a location on your target to aim for. If you hit the target, and roll sufficiently high enough to hit the location you chose, the target will be struck in that area, typically crippling them. If they were holding something and you hit their hand, they will likely drop it. If they were running and you hit their legs, they will likely fall. A latch mechanism that you hit could cause a trap to spring. Your gamemaster will determine the final outcome of a successful Aimed Shot.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your accuracy increases. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Accuracy check for this attack.</p>
<h4 id="brutal-shot">Brutal Shot</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (2 ep)</strong><br />
Use your incredible brawn to display masterful control over your weapon's accuracy. On this attack, only make a Potency check. When determining weapon accuracy and combo hits, use your Potency roll as if it were the result of your Accuracy check.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your shot becomes ever more accurate and ever more deadly. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Potency check for this attack.</p>
<h4 id="concealed-shot">Concealed Shot</h4>
<p><strong>Major Action (2 ep)</strong><br />
Take a shot at a target when they least expect it. When performing this attack, you must only make a Stealth (Agility) check instead of an Accuracy or Potency check. Treat your target's Awareness as the result of their Dodge roll for this attack, and the result of your Stealth roll as the result of your Accuracy and Potency checks for this attack.</p>
<p>When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your shot becomes capable of silently eliminating a foe. You may choose one of the following enhancements for each rank (you may choose the same enhancement more than once):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your attack is well hidden, only your target is aware that you attacked at all. Additionally, if your strike kills your target, they die without a struggle. Even to close observers it appears as though they simply lost consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may Max an additional skill die when performing your Stealth check</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="surgical-shot">Surgical Shot</h4>
