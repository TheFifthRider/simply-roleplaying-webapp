                <h1 id="standard-tests-of-ability">Standard Tests of Ability</h1>
<p>For the most part, <a href="../tests/">tests of ability</a> are intended to be created to fit the situation. However, there are some broad scenarios that will come up in every game that deserve their own specific test.</p>
<h2 id="attacking-with-a-weapon">Attacking with a Weapon</h2>
<p>Attacking with a weapon is a <a href="../tests/">test of ability</a>. The attribute for the test can be any of the attributes that the weapon is tagged with, and the difficulty of the test is the <a href="../../character/equipment/">armor value</a> of the target. </p>
<p>When a character makes a test of any attribute with a goal to <strong>attack with a weapon</strong>, if they...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> Their target takes no damage.</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong> Their target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down.</li>
<li><strong>Fully succeed:</strong> Their target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal the attacker's total for the test.</li>
<li><strong>Critically Succeed:</strong>  Their target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal to double the attacker's total for the test.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, here's the test for attacking an armor value 15 target using a greatsword with the tags <em>brawn</em>, <em>melee</em>, <em>large</em>, <em>cleaving</em>, and <em>slashing</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attacking with a Greatsword</strong></p>
<p><em>Difficulty <strong>15</strong> Test of <strong>Brawn</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Striking the target and inflicting injury</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Not inflicting any damage <!-- TODO: Review, what really is the risk here? Is it really just not inflicting as much damage as hoped? --></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>On a critical success:</strong> the target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal to double the attacker's total for the test.</li>
<li><strong>On a success:</strong> the target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal the attacker's total for the test.</li>
<li><strong>On a failure:</strong> the target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down.</li>
<li><strong>On a critical failure:</strong> the target takes no damage.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="improvised-weapons">Improvised Weapons</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it makes sense that a character can attack with an object not intended to be a weapon or with a weapon in a way that it's not intended to be used. Examples of this could be using a table leg as a cudgel, throwing a maul, or bashing with the butt of a sniper rifle. Attacking in this way technically may violate the range or attributes tagged on the weapon, but should always be possible.</p>
<p>Your gamemaster may rule that a character can use this weapon or object to attack with whatever attribute makes sense for the situation but using it in this way carries an <a href="../tests/#risk-guidelines">additional risk</a> of <strong>being damaged, destroyed, or otherwise lost</strong> in test of ability associated with the attack.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>the gamemaster may say that some tags on the weapon do not apply</strong>-- bashing with the butt of a rifle, for instance, would likely not benefit from the rifle's quality tag, since the quality likely refers to its utility as a ranged weapon, not as a cudgel.</p>
<p>As an example, here's a possible test for attacking an armor value 15 target using the butt of a sniper rifle with the tags <em>agility</em>, <em>long-range</em>, <em>large</em>, and <em>precision</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attacking with the Butt of a Sniper Rifle</strong></p>
<p><em>Difficulty <strong>15</strong> Test of <strong>Brawn</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Striking the target and inflicting injury</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Not inflicting any damage, breaking or damaging the Sniper Rifle <!-- TODO: Review, what really is the risk here? Is it really just not inflicting as much damage as hoped? --></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>On a critical success:</strong> the target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal to double the attacker's total for the test.</li>
<li><strong>On a success:</strong> the target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal the attacker's total for the test.</li>
<li><strong>On a failure:</strong> the target <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">takes damage</a> equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down, and the sniper rifle jams or is otherwise unusable for a short time.</li>
<li><strong>On a critical failure:</strong> the target takes no damage and the sniper rifle gets bent or broken in the scuffle and requires repairs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="making-progress-on-a-complicated-goal">Making Progress on a Complicated Goal</h2>
<p>Sometimes the goal of a test is to make <strong>progress</strong> on a larger goal that can't be resolved by just one test. Such goal might be making something complicated, taking out an enemy, or working as a crew to steer a ship through obstacles. The GM will create a progress meter for the overarching goal of the tests the players-- a total number to reach in order to accomplish the overall goal. Any tests that help accomplish the overall goal can help fill the meter. You can represent this meter just by a total number to hit, or you can draw it on a piece of paper to help illustrate the overall progress, whatever works best for your group.</p>
<p>When a character makes a test of any attribute with a goal to <strong>fill a progress meter</strong>, if they...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> They instead make things more complicated, either by falling victim to an existing risk or introducing a new one.</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong> They are able to make some progress. Fill the progress meter by half of what they rolled.</li>
<li><strong>Fully succeed:</strong> They make great progress. Fill the progress meter by what they rolled.</li>
<li><strong>Critically Succeed:</strong> They make incredible progress. Fill the progress meter by twice what they rolled.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="gathering-information">Gathering Information</h2>
<p>Sometimes the goal of a test is to find <strong>answers to questions</strong>. Such a goal might be researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual. In this case, the results of measure success in number of questions answered. The gamemaster may provide questions that are available to be asked, or allow any question to be asked. </p>
<p>When a character makes a test of any attribute to <strong>find answers to questions</strong>, if they...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> They get unreliable information-- they may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely.</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong> They learn some information-- they may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully.</li>
<li><strong>Succeed:</strong> They learn a good amount of information-- they may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully.</li>
<li><strong>Critically Succeed:</strong> They learn a significant amount of information-- they may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully.</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to the questions should make sense contextually and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question <strong>"Who killed this person?"</strong> with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with <strong>"someone with red hair and a blue cloak"</strong> based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby.</p>
<p>Questions should never feel wasted. If the answer to a question was plain or common knowledge and would not normally require a test to uncover, it should be answered without counting against the number of questions that the tested character can ask. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, the person asked the question should indicate why it is not answerable and it will not count against the number of questions that the character can ask.</p>
<p>Players, if your gamemaster allows you to ask any question but you're not sure what to ask, <strong>"What questions should I ask?"</strong> can be a solid question to ask, since learning the right questions to ask is a crucial step in information gathering. Gamemasters, if this is a question that is somehow unanswerable, make sure you have an answer as to why and how it can become answerable.</p>
