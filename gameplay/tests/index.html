                <h1 id="tests-of-ability">Tests of Ability</h1>
<p>Whenever you take a risk to try to do something your gamemaster will call for a test of ability to determine what happens next. A <strong>test of ability</strong> (or <strong>test</strong> for short) is resolved by rolling <a href="../../character/backgrounds/">skill, legacy, and background dice</a> to see if the roll meets or exceeds a specific number-- the difficulty of doing what you want to do.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-tests">What are tests?</h2>
<p>Most of the time in a game, your gamemaster will just tell you to make a test of a particular attribute, you'll roll the dice and tell them the result, and they'll let you know what happens. </p>
<p>They might say you <strong>failed</strong>, <strong>partially succeedd</strong>, <strong>fully succeeded</strong>, or <strong>critically succeeded</strong> at the test. If you failed you didn't get what you want and you might be in trouble. If you partially succeeded you got what you wanted but only barely, probably at a price. If you fully succeeded you did exactly what you set out to do. If you critically succeeded not only did you do what you set out to do, you rocked it.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-tests">Breaking Down Tests</h2>
<p>While you rarely need to fully write out a test with all of its possible outcomes, if you did it would look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant</strong></p>
<p><em>Difficulty <strong>15</strong> Test of <strong>Presence</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Turning a profit on contraband</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> The merchant might be insulted or involve the authorities</p>
<hr />
<p>If they...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fail:</strong> the merchant gets indignant and starts making a scene. The authorities are sure to get involved immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Partially succeed:</strong> the merchant agrees to buy the contraband, but it seems like they're not likely to want to see you again. They may tip off the authorities, but not until after you've left.</li>
<li><strong>Fully succeed:</strong> you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal</li>
<li><strong>Critically succeed:</strong> not only does the merchant accept the deal but they happen to know a great fence in the area and look forward to working with you again</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="establishing-difficulty">Establishing Difficulty</h2>
<p>So what is the specific number you need to beat in order to do something and how does your GM determine it? The most common case is the difficulty is a value picked by your GM based on the level level a person in their world would have to be to be able to do it with any kind of regularity, something we explore in <a href="../../setting_rules/">setting rules</a>.</p>
<p>Once the GM knows what level you'd have to be do pull this sort of thing off regularly, they can transform that into a difficulty number by multiplying the level by 10, then subtracting 10. For instance, a test that a level 1 character can consistently perform is difficulty 0 and a test that a level 3 character can consistently perform is difficulty 20.</p>
<p>Of course, not all tests are created equal. If your GM feels like what you're doing is particularly easy for the level required, they might lower the difficulty further. If they feel it's a particularly hard, they might raise it. So a test for a level 3 character might be difficulty 15 if it was very easy, 20 if it was something they can handle all the time, and 25 if it's somewhat challenging.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="competitions">Competitions</h3>
<p>When characters directly compete with each other, the gamemaster may rule that it is appropriate to resolve the test by comparing each competing character's roll against each other instead of against a static difficulty. In these <strong>competitions</strong>, the rolls of the other competing characters are considered the difficulty of the test.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="resolving-tests">Resolving Tests</h2>
<p>In most cases the gamemaster will determine what attribute(s) are applicable for the skill check in question and the player will offer up suggestions of skills and/or backgrounds that they have on their character sheet to add the dice associated with those skills and/or backgrounds. A character can contribute one skill or background die to a test of ability up to a maximum equal to their <a href="../advancement/">level</a>. After that, a character can take dice from any relevant <a href="../bonus_dice/">bonus dice</a> and add them to their roll.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="assisting">Assisting</h3>
<p>Before the dice are rolled, any character who can reasonably use one of their skills or backgrounds to help the character performing the test may offer their assistance by choosing the appropriate die and rolling it with the character attempting the test. The character attempting the test may then choose a number of dice less than or equal to their <a href="../advancement/">level</a> to use for the test.</p>
<p>All characters who assist in the test help the tested character reach their goal, making success more likely, but each character who assists in the test also either introduce a new risk to the test or somehow worsen the existing risk, making failure all the more dangerous. If the initial risk was a deadly pitfall, the assisting character could be at risk of falling in as well. If the initial risk was taking too long to researching an antidote before the poison took hold, the additional minds involved might result in a fatal miscommunication.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="determining-the-outcome">Determining the Outcome</h2>
<p>Once the attribute, backgrounds, and skills are all chosen, the dice are rolled and the gamemaster compares the total result to the difficulty of the test and describes what happens. If a character's roll meets or exceeds the difficulty of the test, they have <strong>succeeded</strong> and are able to do what they set out to do. If a character's roll does not meet the difficulty of the test, they have <strong>failed</strong> and things are about to get bad for them.</p>
<p>While success does mean that the character has accomplished what they wanted to, how well they have succeeded determines how much any risks involved affect them. </p>
<p>If a character rolls 20 or more over the difficulty of a test, they have <strong>critically succeeded</strong>; not only did they do what they set out to do and minimize any associated risks, they also get something extra that they wanted or suffer no risks at all!</p>
<p>If a character rolls 10 or more over the difficulty of a test, they have <strong>fully succeeded</strong>; they did what they set out to do and minimize any associated risks.</p>
<p>If a character only meets or exceeds the difficulty of a test, they have <strong>partially succeeded</strong>; they did what they set out to do but they're going to take the brunt of the risks involved.</p>
<p>If a character does not meet the difficulty of the test, they have <strong>failed</strong>-- they don't do what they set out to do and they are either going to suffer the worst possible case of the risks involved or introduce a new risk.</p>
<h3 id="offer-hard-choices-when-there-are-multiple-risks">Offer Hard Choices when there are Multiple Risks</h3>
<p>Lots of tests may have multiple risks involved. Chasing after a bad guy through a crowded alley in an unfamiliar city might have both the risk of letting them get away and getting lost in a part of town you don't know. Gamemasters, while it's perfectly reasonable for a failure on a test to mean "all of the bad stuff that could happen, does happen" consider also offering hard choices to your players on which bad stuff might happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="determining-the-outcome-of-a-competition">Determining the Outcome of a Competition</h3>
<p>Determining the outcome of a competition in which there are two participants is done the same way as determining the outcome in a test with a static difficulty. When more than one character is involved, characters are instead often <strong>ranked from highest to lowest</strong>, based on their roll. The gamemaster can then use these positions to describe the result of the competition based on the relative placement of the competitors.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 id="competition-tiebreakers">Competition Tiebreakers</h4>
<p>Sometimes, characters in a competition might tie. In cases where the gamemaster needs these ties to be broken, other aspects of the tied characters come into question. A tie can be broken by comparing the passive scores of the respective attributes that the characters used for the test. If there is still a tie, that tie is resolved at the gamemaster's discretion, perhaps taking into consideration number of relevant skills/backgrounds or sources of narrative truth. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="example-of-a-test">Example of a Test</h2>
<p>Let's bring it all together and walk through a test of ability using the <strong>Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant</strong> example above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thief character attempts to <em>turn a profit on some contraband</em>. Since this is an action that carries the risk of <em>the merchant becoming upset or involving the authorities</em> and some uncertainty between which of the goal and the risk will occur, the gamemaster calls for a test of ability.</p>
<p>Given the social nature of the action, the gamemaster says that convincing the merchant is going to be a test of <em>Presence</em> and secretly marks down a difficulty of <em>15</em>, since they rule that this requires professional expertise.</p>
<p>On the thief's character sheet are the backgrounds <em>Smuggler</em> and <em>Mercenary</em>, as well as the skills, <em>Acrobatics</em>, <em>Lockpicking</em>, and <em>Intimidation</em>. Based on their current goal, they choose their background <em>Smuggler</em>, and their skill <em>Intimidation</em> as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation.</p>
<p>The gamemaster agrees that these are good choices, so the thief rolls their 1d10 Presence, 1d6 Intimidation, and 1d12 for their Smuggler background.</p>
<p>They roll a 10, a 5, and a 5 for a total of 20--  a spectacular roll. They have a +5 attribute modifier to their Presence, bringing the total of the roll up to 25.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the test was <em>15</em>, and 25 is 10 higher than the difficulty, which makes it a <em>full success</em>. which means <em>you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal</em>. Based on the skills used, the gamemaster now has everything they need to paint a picture of how the sweating merchant responds to the smuggler's intimidation and ultimately gives in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="good-tests">Good Tests</h2>
<p>A test of ability is fundamentally useless without a <strong>goal</strong>, a <strong>risk</strong>, and an <strong>uncertainty</strong>. Without uncertainty, the narrative already clearly indicates what will happen, so it should just happen. Without a goal, the roller's agency is subverted-- if they don't know what they're trying to do, the number rolled doesn't mean anything to them. Without a risk, failure has no cost and the test is drained of tension. At best, it's boring-- at worst it's frustrating.</p>
<p>This is not to say that tests need always be dramatic or life-changing-- changing the lettering of a sign to prank a party member is as valid a goal as crossing a precarious bridge. Getting caught in the middle of defacing a street sign is still a risk, it's just a less obvious one than tumbling off of that precarious bridge.</p>
<p>The concept of goals and risks is something that relies on the players being immersed in their character, their surroundings, and the world at large. If you're playing with a bunch of people new to the system, take some time in an introductory dungeon to help your players think in terms of the goals they want to perform and the risks that might come with them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="goal-guidelines">Goal Guidelines</h3>
<p>Goals are a statement of intent and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. Gamemasters, this is the part of skill checks that fall on the players to define. You should be prepared to ask questions until you are absolutely certain of the intention of the player's actions. If a player doesn't know what they are trying to do in the situation, the gamemaster should present some options like you might find in a choose-your-own-adventure novel.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="risk-guidelines">Risk Guidelines</h3>
<p>Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as taking a chainsaw to the chest, and should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night or missing a crucial detail.</p>
