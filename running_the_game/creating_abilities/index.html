                <h1 id="creating-balanced-abilities">Creating Balanced Abilities</h1>
<h2 id="keeping-it-all-balanced">Keeping it All "Balanced"</h2>
<p>Gamemasters, you're probably wondering if there's some kind of behind-the-scenes formula for making a balanced ability. The short answer is: there isn't. At least not up front.</p>
<p>The longer answer is there isn't, but not for a lack of trying. I spent quite some time working out various systems for point-buying your way to "balanced" abilities, but at the end of the day they all ended up being unbalanced in one way or another. After all, if you are a player with an ability that turns all of your d12s into d20s when you attack an undead enemy, how useful that ability is depends entirely on how often the GM pits you against undead enemies. If you have an ability to fly, how useful that ability is depends on how often you need to and couldn't otherwise.</p>
<p>Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities <em>as you go</em>. If an ability feels too strong? Give it an extra requirement, or make one of its requirements more costly! If an ability feels too weak? Give it an extra effect or strengthen one of its existing effects without requiring the character to upgrade it.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-not-restrictions">Requirements, not Restrictions</h3>
<p>Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them. If a player wants to make an ability called <em>Godmode</em> that <em>makes them immortal.</em> That should be on the table no matter how gamebreaking it appears. Protagonists with the ability to shape the world to their whim can create a compelling story. </p>
<p>Just make sure you and/or your player check in with the rest of the table-- they may not want to play a TTRPG where somebody has cheat codes on. As long as you make sure that everyone is on the same page and having fun, that's what matters.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Every ability has <strong>requirements</strong> that must be met for you to be able to use it. The more requirements an ability has, or the more costly the requirements, the more powerful the ability should be. Often, requirements will be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wielding a specific tool, like being required to <em>use weapons specific to your art</em> to use a martial arts technique</li>
<li>Being in a specific situation, like being required to be <em>defending against a melee attack</em> to perform a counter</li>
<li>Taking a specific amount of time, like being required to <em>spend some downtime</em> to create a potion</li>
<li>Fulfilling a specific narrative goal, like being required to <em>memorize a character's mannerisms</em> to disguise yourself as them</li>
<li>Spending a specific resource, like being required to <em>spend mana</em> to cast a spell (usually, spending ability points)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-requirements">Optional Requirements</h3>
<p>You can make an ability more flexible by making it stronger if more requirements are met. These <strong>optional requirements</strong> are often things like spending extra ability points, taking additional time, or fulfilling an extra goal. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Craft a Disguise</strong>
  If you've spent at least one period of downtime every day for the last seven days observing a character, you can disguise yourself as that character. You automatically pass as them visually and at a distance.<br/><em>If you've spent at least two periods of downtime each day observing them,</em> you better understand their mannerisms. You automatically pass as them when interacting with all but their closest friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="abilities-and-others">Abilities and Others</h2>
<p>If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a <a href="../../gameplay/tests/">Test of Ability</a> to resist the effects, setting the <strong>Difficulty</strong> and describing what happens if they <strong>Critically Succeed</strong>, <strong>Succeed</strong>, <strong>Partially Succeed</strong>, or <strong>Fail</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="abilities-growing-with-level">Abilities Growing with Level</h2>
<p>When making an ability, you may not want all aspects of the ability to be improved by a player choosing to <strong>improve an ability</strong>-- increasing the difficulties for tests, the size of stacked dice, or the <strong>+X</strong> tag on ability-created equipment aren't things that necessarily feel rewarding to level up. Improving an ability should always feel like an improvement, it should never feel like keeping up.</p>
<p>To that end, certain aspects of abilities should increase automatically as a character levels up. Dice stacked by an ability, for example, might start as d4s at level 1 and increase every two levels until level 8, when they become d12s. Test difficulties might increase by 10 every level. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Die</th>
<th>Equipment Quality</th>
<th>Test difficulty</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1d4</td>
<td>+0</td>

<p>You can also tie effects to things that are automatically improved every level like health, passive ability scores, and total dice.</p>
<h3 id="creating-multiple-types-of-ability-points">Creating Multiple types of Ability Points</h3>
<p>Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their <em>mana</em> to use abilities related to their magic power might also have <em>flourishes</em> that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both <em>ammunition</em> for their arsenal of weapons and <em>psi points</em>. An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions.</p>
<p>You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you only gain that many ability points in total-- you must choose which of your types of ability points increase.</p>
<h3 id="customizing-ability-points">Customizing Ability Points</h3>
<p>If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it.</p>
<p>If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities.</p>
<h2 id="lets-make-some-abilities">Let's Make Some Abilities</h2>
<p>All right, we've spent enough time talking about how they work. Let's make some ability points and an ability to use them.</p>
<h3 id="tinkering-inventor">Tinkering Inventor</h3>
<p>What if our character was a <em>Tinkering Inventor</em>? Someone who can always make the right tools for the job. Their abilities could be the inventions they create, powered by the <strong>scrap</strong> that the Inventor uses to make them. One ability could be <strong>Springloaded Boots</strong>-- a cobbled together contraption that allows the wearer to leap further and run faster... until it breaks. That's pretty easy to represent as stacks of dice that the Inventor puts together over some downtime.</p>

<h3 id="alchemist">Alchemist</h3>
<p>What if our character was an <em>Alchemist</em> who produced poisons and potions? Their abilities could be the various potions effects they know how to make, powered by the <strong>concoctions</strong> that the Alchemist brews when the party rests. One ability could be a <strong>Health Potion</strong> that heals a bit of damage.</p>

<h3 id="unassuming-assassin">Unassuming Assassin</h3>
<p>What if our character was an <em>Unassuming Assassin</em>? Someone small or frail who nonetheless is a lethal threat. Their abilities could be powered by their ability to mentally note their enemy's weak spots with <strong>assassin's marks</strong>. One ability could be <strong>Strike Their Weaknesses</strong>-- a technique to make attacks with anything based on intuitive analysis rather than strength or speed.</p>

<h3 id="internet-savant">Internet Savant</h3>
<p>What if our character was an <em>Internet Savant</em> who mastered the art of utilizing the collective human knowledge present on the web?

<p>What if our character was a <em>Street Brawler</em> who was used to using anything at their disposal in a scrap? Their abilities could be powered by their <strong>reputation</strong> as a fighter.

<p>Here's a more in-detail example of how one could make an ability stronger over the course of multiple enhancements.</p>
<p>Let's start with the ability <strong>Berserking</strong></p>

<p>A good starting point, but let's see if we can make it more interesting.</p>
<p>The next chance we get to improve abilities, we choose to <strong>make the ability stronger</strong>. We can't increase the number of dice that we have, but we can change the dice into a stack that can be used more than once. Since stacks are more broadly useful than just attacks, let's also change the trigger to an action.</p>

<td>...stack <strong>2d4 Berserking</strong> in my favor for the scene.</td>

</tbody>

<p>Already this is looking jucier. Now, not only do we get a 1d4 bonus to attacks, but we can also spend the dice from the stack for breaking down doors, resisting mind control, and all kinds of other stuff that having a <strong>Berserking</strong> stack might help with.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Well, a simple route would just be to increase the number of dice that we have on the Berserking stack to get more Berserking Time, but what if we made it a special stack? We'd need our gamemaster's approval and their help making some balanced tweaks, but with their help we could come up with something like...</p>
<h4 id="berserking-iii">Berserking III</h4>

<tr>
<td>By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to...</td>
<td>...stack <strong>1d4 Berserking</strong> in my favor for the scene with the following rules:</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berserking</strong></p>
<p>When you <strong>make an attack</strong>, stack another die.
The first time you <strong>take damage</strong> each turn, stack another die.
If you end your turn without removing a die from the stack, they are all lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what our gamemaster helped us come up with. They're a special stack that feeds themselves the more that we attack and take damage, but have the downside of needing to be used at least once on each of our turns or they go away. Now we're really getting somewhere! </p>
<p>But... what if we could make it <em>even better?</em> Our gamemaster has an idea for that-- they say that if we want to, we can upgrade the ability again to remove the restriction that causes us to lose the stack.</p>

<p>Wow. We are now three improvements deep into this ability and it feels pretty powerful indeed. By spending just one of our resources, we get powerful  these dice that we can feed off of making attacks and taking damage, like a true berserker might. If we play our cards right, we'll be adding dice front, left, and center all battle long!</p>
