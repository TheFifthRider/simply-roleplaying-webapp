There were six players, ranging from experienced players to players who had only ever heard of roleplaying. At the time I was running two weekly D6 Fantasy campaigns and I was eager to play-- there was just one problem. I didn't have any of my D6 Fantasy materials. All I had was a single set of polyhedral dice. So I winged it. Every roleplaying system I had ever played had attributes and the d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 seemed like an easy way to rank strengths and weaknesses, so I decided on five attributes (Agility, Brawn, Mental, Charisma, and Luck) and had each player distribute the five dice between them. We streamlined character creation, I gave them a prompt for a one-shot that left their backstory a mystery with a hint of excitement, and we got to the business of playing the game. The one-shot turned into a campaign and it became clear that the system worked for my players, but it needed to develop. As players asked me to do things and how to do things, I improvised ways it could be done and whatever worked, stuck. And so the system grew, piece by piece, based on what the players wanted or needed for the campaign. The system as it is now is still a work in progress. I've been through many revisions, and there will likely be many more. But it was the simplicity of that first session that got it all started, and simplicity without losing nuance has been and will always be my guiding principle. About Me Hey! I'm Richard. When I was younger, I loved to tinker with the rules for any board game I played, often before I had finished playing the game once and to the dismay of anyone I played with. When I joined my parents' AD&D group, I started writing rule supplements for doing things that I thought would be cool, like overhauling the process for crafting and enchanting a weapon. They still play, by the way-- they made the switch to 5e a year or so after it got released. I started putting pen to paper on my own games and systems in middle school. Any system I made was something that needed to be simple enough to be played on a whim at the lunch table or on a campout-- so that meant no dice or character sheets, let alone prep material. As a result, the systems I made were heavily narratively focused and had few mechanics beyond my players describing what they wanted to do and me improvising a world in response. In high school I built out a simple system with proper mechanics that was heavily inspired by Fire Emblem, and in college I started devouring other systems to learn from all the cool stuff that's out there! Outside of roleplaying games, I dig video games and I have a rather sizeable collection of board games of which I'm proud to say there are only a few that I've never played. I also \"spend a lot of time thinking about time\" as my roommate puts it-- there's something about having a good todo list and time tracker going that just really helps me keep everything in my life running smoothly.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-simply-roleplaying","text":"Simply Roleplaying started in 2013 at a friend's birthday party in college when somebody suggested I run a one-shot session.

Action scenarios are so named because they are the stuff that action movies are full of. Action scenarios are turn based and typically follow the same rules, however some types of action scenarios may define special things you can do with your actions that fit the theme of the scenario. Rounds Action scenarios are turn based and take place over blocks of time referred to as rounds . A full round usually is considered to take ten seconds of game time, but gamemasters may adjust this based on what makes sense for the action scenario. Most of the time, each character involved in the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking a turn in a specific order. Actions On their turn each character can take up to 3 actions . One action on its own can be used to do something quick that does not require much complex thought. Running a short distance, making an attack, jumping a gap, climbing a ladder, hiding behind a pillar, or triggering a mechanism are all examples of actions. Spending Multiple Actions A character can spend multiple actions in succession to do something complicated or time consuming. Casting a spell, repairing broken machinery, deciphering a complicated message, rolling a boulder out of the way, or hacking a computer terminal are examples of things that might take multiple actions. If the character does not have enough actions to do something completely, they can still spend what actions they have towards the total cost of whatever they want to do. Until the full cost is paid, they are considered to be focusing on it. If they use an action to do anything else, their progress is lost. If it makes sense, a character who is focusing on doing something can be helped by other characters on their turns, allowing the group to speed up the process of doing something particularly complicated or time consuming by working together. Reactions In addition to the actions that they can perform on their turn, characters can also react to another character's action, performing one action in response. Characters can only react once per round. If they do not react by the start of their next turn, they may perform one extra action on that turn. Some examples of reactions are ducking behind cover, dodging away from a fatal blow, closing a door, or activating a simple mechanism. Chases Chases are a special kind of action scenario that capture the fast back-and-forth between participants in a race. Unlike other action scenarios, there's no reacting in chases. In addition, there are several special actions that can be performed in a chase, detailed here . Freeform Action Scenarios The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when observing strict rules for an action scenario would get in the way of the drama of the scene. A freeform scenario is any scenario that uses some, but not all, rules that are normally a part of an action scenario.

The attribute for the test can be any of the attributes that the weapon is tagged with, and the difficulty of the test is the armor value of the target. Success on the test means dealing damage equal to the amount the attacker rolled, a critical success means double damage, a failure means half damage, and a critical failure means do damage at all. As an example, here's the test for attacking an armor value 15 target using a greatsword with the tags brawn , melee , large , cleaving , and slashing : Attacking with a Greatsword Difficulty 15 Test of Brawn Goal: Striking the target and inflicting injury Risk: Not inflicting any damage On a critical success: the target takes damage equal to double the attacker's total for the test. On a success: the target takes damage equal the attacker's total for the test. On a failure: the target takes damage equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down. On a critical failure: the target takes no damage. Improvised Weapons Sometimes, it makes sense that a character can attack with an object not intended to be a weapon or with a weapon in a way that it's not intended to be used. Examples of this could be using a table leg as a cudgel, throwing a maul, or bashing with the butt of a sniper rifle. Attacking in this way technically may violate the range or attributes tagged on the weapon, but should always be possible. Your gamemaster may rule that a character can use this weapon or object to attack with whatever attribute makes sense for the situation but using it in this way carries an additional risk of being damaged, destroyed, or otherwise lost in test of ability associated with the attack. For more on risks, see Making Good Tests . In addition, the gamemaster may say that some tags on the weapon do not apply -- bashing with the butt of a rifle, for instance, would likely not benefit from the rifle's quality tag, since the quality likely refers to its utility as a ranged weapon, not as a cudgel. As an example, here's a possible test for attacking an armor value 15 target using the butt of a sniper rifle with the tags agility , long-range , large , and precision : Attacking with the Butt of a Sniper Rifle Difficulty 15 Test of Brawn Goal: Striking the target and inflicting injury Risk: Not inflicting any damage, breaking or damaging the Sniper Rifle On a critical success: the target takes damage equal to double the attacker's total for the test. On a success: the target takes damage equal the attacker's total for the test. On a failure: the target takes damage equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down, and the sniper rifle jams or is otherwise unusable for a short time. On a critical failure: the target takes no damage and the sniper rifle gets bent or broken in the scuffle and requires repairs.","title":"Attacking"},{"location":"action/attacking/#attacking-with-a-weapon","text":"Attacking with a weapon is a test of ability .

Chases are action scenarios best suited for when participants are competing to reach a particular goal . A footrace across the room may be over in a matter of seconds, a car chase across the interstate may take hours, and chasing across countries might even take days. Whatever the scope of the chase, each character in a chase has a position that is described by their distance from the goal in actions. Acting in a Chase When in a chase, there are a few special actions available to its participants: closing to progress towards the goal, performing a stunt to take a risk to get closer faster, creating an obstacle to slow down other participants, and creating a shortcut to speed up other participants. A character can always spend their actions on doing other things, however as always the gamemaster must rule that the action makes sense in the context. Closing A character who uses an action to close decreases their distance to the goal by one action. This represents doing whatever is necessary to get closer to the goal, be it kicking down a door, running across a room, or speeding down the highway. Performing a Stunt A character who uses their action to perform a stunt takes a risk to try to get to the goal faster. Stunts are complicated, so they take at least 2 actions to perform. Based on the stunt described, the player can wager a number of actions as the cost of the stunt-- based on the number of actions it takes and the action described, the gamemaster will then devise a test of ability to determine what is necessary to successfully pull off the stunt. If the character... Fails, the stunt goes wrong in some way. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test. Partially succeeds, their stunt is successful, but not as efficient as it could have been. They move towards the goal with the same number of actions that they spent on the stunt, then move towards the goal by a further action. They also suffer some risk from the test. Fully succeeds, their stunt is fully successful. They move towards the goal a number of actions equal to twice the number of actions they spent on the stunt and will effectively minimize the risk from the test. Critically succeeds, their stunt is wildly successful. They move towards the goal a number of actions equal to twice the number of actions they spent on the stunt, then move 2 further actions towards the goal. Creating an Obstacle or Shortcut A character who uses their actions to create an obstacle or create a shortcut chooses to not move closer to the goal, but rather change the chase for other participants. Just like stunts, creating obstacles and shortcuts are complicated and require at least 2 actions to perform. Based on what makes sense, the gamemaster will determine who in the chase is affected by the obstacle or shortcut. Like performing a stunt, the character wagers a number of actions that this obstacle or shortcut is worth and the gamemaster establishes a test of ability to determine whether the creation of the obstacle or shortcut is successful or not. Creating an Obstacle If the character... Fails, the obstacle could not be created. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test. Partially succeeds, the obstacle was created, but offers only marginal benefit. All affected participants are moved 1 action away from the goal to represent the obstacle's delay and the character suffers some risk from the test. Fully succeeds, the obstacle was created successfully. All affected participants are moved a number of actions away from the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the obstacle. Critically succeeds, the obstacle was particularly effective. All affected participants are moved a number of actions away from the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the obstacle plus 1. Creating a Shortcut If the character... Fails, the shortcut could not be created. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test. Partially succeeds, the shortcut was created, but offers only marginal benefit. All affected participants are moved 1 action towards the goal to represent the time saved by the shortcut and the character suffers some risk from the test. Fully succeeds, the shortcut was created successfully. All affected participants are moved a number of actions towards the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the shortcut. Critically succeeds, the shortcut was created and is particularly effective. All affected participants are moved a number of actions towards the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the shortcut plus 1. Shaking Pursuit Sometimes, a chase will be initiated by pursuit. While usually the pursued character is fleeing to somewhere (in which case, a typical chase towards a goal is appropriate), occasionally the pursued character's goal is simply to shake their pursuers. In this case, the pursued character's position is considered to be the goal of the chase and any actions that the pursued character takes that would move them towards the goal instead move all their pursuers that many actions away.","title":"Chases"},{"location":"action/chases/#chases","text":"A necromancer flees as the tide turns against his undead minions, an archeologist braves the ocean to be first to reach an ancient tomb, a spy dashes through the hangar towards their getaway starship fueled for takeoff.

A medic presses the defibrillator to a fallen comrade's chest, returning the spark of life. A single captain stands tall brandishing a tattered flag, inspiring the defenders to fight on. Roleplaying is full of heroic moments when the action gets fierce. The Simply Combat Techniques module gives each weapon their own unique abilities in combat, so heroes and villains can inspire these moments that much more often. Melee Weapons General Aimed Strike Major Action (1 ep) Swing your weapon towards a specific area on your target's body to cripple them. Make an attack and specify a location on your target to aim for. If you hit the target and roll sufficiently high enough to hit the location you chose, inflict some kind of detriment to them based on the area hit. If they were holding something and you hit their hand, they will likely drop it. If they were running and you hit their legs, they will likely fall. A latch mechanism that you hit could cause a trap to spring. Your gamemaster will determine the final outcome of a successful Aimed Strike. When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your accuracy increases. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Accuracy check for this attack. Brutal Strike Major Action (2 ep) Use your tremendous strength to bring down a swift and nigh-inescapable blow. Perform an attack, but only make a Potency check instead of an Accuracy check and Potency check. When determining weapon accuracy, use your Potency roll as if it were the result of your Accuracy check. When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your blow becomes even more vicious. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Potency check for this attack. Concealed Strike Major Action (2 ep) Strike a target when they least expect it. Perform an attack but make a Stealth (Agility) check instead of an Accuracy check and Potency check. Treat your target's Awareness as the result of their Dodge roll for this attack, and the result of your Stealth roll as the result of your Accuracy and Potency checks for this attack. When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your strike becomes capable of silently eliminating a foe. You may choose one of the following enhancements for each rank (you may choose the same enhancement more than once): Your attack is well hidden, only your target is aware that you attacked at all. Additionally, if your strike kills your target, they die without a struggle. Even to close observers it appears as though they simply lost consciousness. You may Max an additional skill die when performing your Stealth check Surgical Strike Major Action (2 ep) Use your expert precision to attack where the target's defenses are weakest. Perform an attack, but only make an Accuracy check instead of an Accuracy check and Potency check. When determining weapon damage, use your Accuracy roll as if it was the result of your Potency roll. When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your strike becomes even more precise. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Accuracy check for this attack. Charge Major Action (2 ep) Rush forward and use your momentum to strike at a target. Move in a straight line up to your movement speed, then perform an attack. When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your charge is significantly more flexible and powerful. You may choose one of the following enhancements for each rank: You may move past your target if you have not moved your full movement speed, regardless of if you hit your target or not. For this attack, you may treat any enemy along the line you charged as within melee range of you. You may carry your target with you if you hit with this attack and have not moved your full movement speed. If you collide with obstructions along this path, your target suffers an additional blow as if from an improvised weapon of the appropriate size of the obstruction, using your potency roll from this attack to determine the damage of the improvised weapon. You may continue to carry your target past each obstruction, provided you break through them or are able to knock them out of the way, until you have encountered a number of obstructions greater than the number of times you have chosen this enhancement. Grapple/Tackle Major Action (1 ep) Grab an enemy and restrain them, restricting their movement and removing their ability to dodge. Have a Grapple (Brawn) contest with your target. If you have used your minor action to move toward your intended target this turn, you may instead tackle them and max one of your dice when performing your Grapple check, but must take a minor action on your following turn to get back up. If you are successful, your target is prevented from using any major or minor actions that require movement and skip their next turn. Additionally, you move at half speed and must min your stat die (or dice) on any skill check that requires movement. On their turn, your target may take a major action to perform a Grapple contest with you. If they are successful, they free themselves. If they are unsuccessful, they gain a +1 bonus to subsequent attempts against this Grapple.

To do this in Simply Roleplaying, at the beginning of the action scenario each participant makes an Intuition roll (adding their modifier as normal) and marks the result of this value as their initiative for the scenario. Characters then take their turn in order from highest roll to lowest roll. Ties can be broken by the character's passive intuition score , then by the die level of the Intuition attribute-- d6s beat d4s, d8s beat d6s and so forth. Further ties can be broken at GM discretion. At the end of each round, after all characters have taken their turn, characters who join the action after the initial rolls roll for initiative and are sorted into the initiative order based on their roll. Delaying your turn Sometimes a character will wish to take their turn at a later time. Perhaps the room has filled with smoke and they're waiting for a clear shot, or the enemy mage is about to cast a spell and they want to wait out the attack. In whatever case this might be, the character may choose to delay their turn until a later time in the round. Before any character with a lower initiative score takes their turn, the delayed character may take their turn. If more than one character are delaying their turns at the same time, each character is given the opportunity to take their delayed turn in initiative order. If a character is delaying their turn at the end of the round, they are given one final opportunity to take their turn. Delayed turns cannot carry over between rounds. Elective Action Order The following is adapted from the ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post Accidentally Designing Marvel\u2019s Action Order System . Elective Action Order allows for a more teamwork-centric and tactical approach to initiative order by giving each character the ability to determine who acts after them. After rolling for initiative, instead of ordering participants from highest roll to lowest roll, the highest roller is declared the first to act. In the case of an ambush, tensions broken by the first shot fired, or some other situation where it is clear who will (or has) acted first gamemasters may opt to skip rolling and instead start the turn order with that character. Then, after each participant finishes their turn, they choose another participant who has not taken a turn yet this round to take their turn next. If another character interrupts the turn order the chosen character does not take their turn. Instead, the interrupting character may take their turn if they have not already done so in this round, then choose the next participant to act. Once all participants in a round have taken their turn, characters who are not participants in the combat can become participants. Then, the last participant to take a turn in the round chooses the participant starts the next round. Elective Action Order in Practice Gamemasters, if you intend to use Elective Action Order you should be aware of its tactical advantages and disadvantages. One question you will likely be asked immediately is \"why would I ever pass to an enemy?\" The answer here lies in vying for control of the end of the round, since the decides the order of the next round. Used cleverly, this can allow key players or even the entire team the opportunity to take two uninterrupted turns in a row-- one at the end of the round, and one at the start of the next round. In addition, making sure that the enemies of the combat are clearly distinct so your players can easily identify who they are choosing to go next. If you have a bunch of largely indistinguishable non-player characters, consider clearly defining squads of those non-player characters. Squads are simply made up of characters that will always pass their action to another character in their \"squad\" until none are available. this helps your players (and you!) so the turn can be passed to \"the bandits\" instead of needing to specify which specific bandit they're referring to.","title":"Roll for Initiative"},{"location":"action/turns/#roll-for-initiative","text":"There are several ways of determining the character order in rounds, the most iconic in tabletop games is rolling for initiative .

One question you will likely be asked immediately is \"why would I ever pass to an enemy?\" The answer here lies in vying for control of the end of the round, since the decides the order of the next round. Used cleverly, this can allow key players or even the entire team the opportunity to take two uninterrupted turns in a row-- one at the end of the round, and one at the start of the next round. In addition, making sure that the enemies of the combat are clearly distinct so your players can easily identify who they are choosing to go next. If you have a bunch of largely indistinguishable non-player characters, consider clearly defining squads of those non-player characters. Squads are simply made up of characters that will always pass their action to another character in their \"squad\" until none are available. this helps your players (and you!) so the turn can be passed to \"the bandits\" instead of needing to specify which specific bandit they're referring to.","title":"Elective Action Order in Practice"},{"location":"basics/companions/","text":"Companions Companions are characters that adventure alongside your character-- be they a mentor, a sibling, or an animal with whom you've formed a lasting bond.

This is ultimately up to the gamemaster to determine, but about one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is usually right for an average session. Milestones Milestones are markers of when the player characters advance and are awarded to celebrate the significant things the players have accomplished over the course of the game. Milestones typically occur at the end of significant arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. Whenever character's achieve milestones, they are awarded a larger than average amount of potential, their attribute modifiers increase, and they get to add one additional die to tests of ability. Increase your by 1 Choose two attributes and increase their modifiers by 4, then: If you chose agility as one of these attributes, gain If you chose brawn as one of these attributes, gain 25 maximum damage If you chose intuition as one of these attributes, gain If you chose knowledge as one of these attributes, gain If you chose presence as one of these attributes, gain If you chose will as one of these attributes, gain an injury box Choose two more attributes and increase their modifiers by 3 Increase the modifiers for your final two attributes by 2 When to give Milestones This section is largely for gamemasters, players you can skip it if you'd like. A good rule of thumb for awarding milestones is to give a milestone about every 25 potential earned, and to grant roughly two session's worth of potential when you do so. If you use session goals, this should happen more or less naturally as milestones tend to come after sessions that have players check all the boxes. If it doesn't come naturally, feel free to come up with additional session goals for accomplishing significant arcs, defeating significant foes, or whatever best suits your campaign. Whatever you choose, session goals should be about celebrating the accomplishments of the player characters and the story you are all weaving together. Checklists and Goals An interactive way of determining how many points of potential to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with \"Gain a point of potential if we...\"-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential. Here are some end-of-session goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session, along with the milestone instructions in checklist form. At the end of a session: Gain a point of potential if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by Gain a point of potential if we accomplished something new and important Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about the world Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about one of the player characters When a milestone is achieved: Increase your by 1 Increase two attribute modifiers by 5, then: Gain if one of the attributes was agility Increase your maximum damage by 25 if one of the attributes was brawn Gain if one of the attributes was intuition Gain if one of the attributes was knowledge Gain an injury box if one of the attributes was will Increase two attribute modifiers by 4 Increase two attribute modifiers by 3","title":"Advancement"},{"location":"basics/milestones/#advancement","text":"","title":"Advancement"},{"location":"basics/milestones/#every-session","text":"At the end of every session, a character earns some amount of potential, varying based on the significance of what happened in the campaign.

Increase your by 1 Choose two attributes and increase their modifiers by 4, then: If you chose agility as one of these attributes, gain If you chose brawn as one of these attributes, gain 25 maximum damage If you chose intuition as one of these attributes, gain If you chose knowledge as one of these attributes, gain If you chose presence as one of these attributes, gain If you chose will as one of these attributes, gain an injury box Choose two more attributes and increase their modifiers by 3 Increase the modifiers for your final two attributes by 2","title":"Milestones"},{"location":"basics/milestones/#when-to-give-milestones","text":"This section is largely for gamemasters, players you can skip it if you'd like. A good rule of thumb for awarding milestones is to give a milestone about every 25 potential earned, and to grant roughly two session's worth of potential when you do so. If you use session goals, this should happen more or less naturally as milestones tend to come after sessions that have players check all the boxes. If it doesn't come naturally, feel free to come up with additional session goals for accomplishing significant arcs, defeating significant foes, or whatever best suits your campaign. Whatever you choose, session goals should be about celebrating the accomplishments of the player characters and the story you are all weaving together.","title":"When to give Milestones"},{"location":"basics/milestones/#checklists-and-goals","text":"An interactive way of determining how many points of potential to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals.

A test of ability (or test for short) is resolved by rolling an attribute die, along with some combination of skill and background dice to meet or exceed a number that represents the difficulty of doing what they want to do. While most tests emerge fluidly from gameplay and don't require this level of detail, a fully written test would look something like this: Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant Difficulty 15 Test of Presence Goal: Turning a profit on contraband Risk: The merchant might be insulted or involve the authorities If they... Fail: the merchant refuses to do business with you ever again and tips off the authorities Partially succeed: the merchant refuses to buy the contraband and threatens to involve the authorities if you ever try to sell them contraband again Fully succeed: you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal Critically succeed: not only does the merchant accept the deal but they happen to be a known fence in the area and look forward to working with you again Establishing Difficulty Most of the time, the difficulty is a static number determined by the gamemaster based on the skill required to achieve success with minimal risk. Below are a collection of difficulty rules of thumb. When creating a test, it's a good idea to start with a difficulty based on one of the rules of thumb and increase or decrease it by a few points depending on how easy or difficult the test is meant to be. Talented but inexperienced characters who have yet to earn a milestone can handle tests of difficulty 5 Experienced characters who have earned a milestone can handle tests of difficulty 10 Professionals who have earned two milestones can handle tests of difficulty 20 Experts who have earned three milestones can handle tests of difficulty 30 Masters who have earned four milestones can handle tests of difficulty 40 Only Legendary characters can attempt to handle tests of difficulty 50 or higher Players, the difficulty rules of thumb can also help you gauge your character's proficiency. If you're regularly rolling above a 15 on a test, chances are you are on the same level as someone who performs those sorts of tests for a living. Gamemasters, if you choose to use more than three skill milestones and three attribute milestones, you should consider writing your own rules of thumb not only to help yourself consistently apply difficulties across your world, but also to help your players understand what rolling a 10 means when compared to the rest of your world's citizens. Competitions When characters directly compete with each other, the gamemaster may rule that it is appropriate to resolve the test by comparing each competing character's roll against each other instead of against a static difficulty. In these competitions , the rolls of the other competing characters are considered the difficulty of the test. Resolving Tests In most cases the gamemaster will determine what attribute(s) are applicable for the skill check in question and the player will offer up suggestions of skills and/or backgrounds that they have on their character sheet to add the dice associated with those skills and/or backgrounds. A character can contribute one skill or background die to a test of ability up to the total amount allowed by their earned milestones . Aid Before the dice are rolled, any character who can reasonably use one of their skills or backgrounds to help the character performing the test may offer their aid by choosing the appropriate die and rolling it with the character attempting the test. The character attempting the test may then choose a number of dice up to the total amount allowed by their earned milestones to use for the test. All characters who aid in the test help the tested character reach their goal, making success more likely, but each character who aids in the test also either introduce a new risk to the test or somehow worsen the existing risk, making failure all the more dangerous. If the initial risk was a deadly pitfall, the aiding character could be at risk of falling in as well. If the initial risk was taking too long to researching an antidote before the poison took hold, the additional minds involved might result in a fatal miscommunication. Determining the Outcome Once the attribute, backgrounds, and skills are all chosen, the dice are rolled and the gamemaster compares the total result to the difficulty of the test and describes what happens. If a character's roll meets or exceeds the difficulty of the test, they have succeeded and are able to do what they set out to do. If a character's roll does not meet the difficulty of the test, they have failed and things are about to get bad for them. While success does mean that the character has accomplished what they wanted to, how well they have succeeded determines how much any risks involved affect them. If a character rolls 20 or more over the difficulty of a test, they have critically succeeded ; they either avoid the risks involved entirely or succeed to an incredible degree. If a character rolls 10 or more over the difficulty of a test, they have fully succeeded ; they did what they set out to do and minimize any associated risks. If a character only meets or exceeds the difficulty of a test, they have partially succeeded ; they did what they set out to do but they're going to take the brunt of the risks involved. If a character does not meet the difficulty of the test, they have failed -- they don't do what they set out to do and they are either going to suffer the worst possible case of the risks involved or introduce a new risk. Determining the Outcome of a Competition Determining the outcome of a competition in which there are two participants is done the same way as determining the outcome in a test with a static difficulty. When more than one character is involved, characters are instead often ranked from highest to lowest , based on their roll. The gamemaster can then use these positions to describe the result of the competition based on the relative placement of the competitors. Example of a Test Let's bring it all together and walk through a test of ability using the Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant example above: A thief character attempts to turn a profit on some contraband . Since this is an action that carries the risk of the merchant becoming upset or involving the authorities and some uncertainty between which of the goal and the risk will occur, the gamemaster calls for a test of ability. Given the social nature of the action, the gamemaster says that convincing the merchant is going to be a test of Presence and secretly marks down a difficulty of 15 , since they rule that this requires professional expertise. On the thief's character sheet are the backgrounds Smuggler and Mercenary , as well as the skills, Acrobatics , Lockpicking , and Intimidation . Based on their current goal, they choose their background Smuggler , and their skill Intimidation as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation. The gamemaster agrees that these are good choices, so the thief rolls their 1d10 Presence, 1d6 Intimidation, and 1d12 for their Smuggler background. They roll a 10, a 5, and a 5 for a total of 20-- a spectacular roll. They have a +5 attribute modifier to their Presence, bringing the total of the roll up to 25. The difficulty of the test was 15 , and 25 is 10 higher than the difficulty, which makes it a full success . which means you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal . Based on the skills used, the gamemaster now has everything they need to paint a picture of how the sweating merchant responds to the smuggler's intimidation and ultimately gives in. Other Types of Outcomes Accomplishing what a character set out to do can be nebulous, especially when a the goal of a test is complicated or open ended. In those cases, consider the following rules for handling situations where the goal is to make progress on a larger task, or to gather information . Progress as an Outcome Sometimes the goal of a test is to make progress on a larger goal that can't be resolved by just one test. Such goal might be making something complicated, taking out an enemy, or working as a crew to steer a ship through obstacles. The GM will create a progress meter for the overarching goal of the tests the players-- a total number to reach in order to accomplish the overall goal. Any tests that help accomplish the overall goal can help fill the meter. You can represent this meter just by a total number to hit, or you can draw it on a piece of paper to help illustrate the overall progress, whatever works best for your group. When a character makes a test of any attribute with a goal to fill a progress meter , if they... Fail: They instead make things more complicated, either by falling victim to an existing risk or introducing a new one. Partially succeed: They are able to make some progress. Fill the progress meter by half of what they rolled. Fully succeed: They make great progress. Fill the progress meter by what they rolled. Critically Succeed: They make incredible progress. Fill the progress meter by twice what they rolled. Information as an Outcome Sometimes the goal of a test is to find answers to questions . Such a goal might be researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual. In this case, the results of measure success in number of questions answered. The gamemaster may provide questions that are available to be asked, or allow any question to be asked. When a character makes a test of any attribute to find answers to questions , if they... Fail: They get unreliable information-- they may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely. Partially succeed: They learn some information-- they may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully. Succeed: They learn a good amount of information-- they may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully. Critically Succeed: They learn a significant amount of information-- they may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully. The answers to the questions should make sense contextually and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question \"Who killed this person?\" with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with \"someone with red hair and a blue cloak\" based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby. Questions should never feel wasted. If the answer to a question was plain or common knowledge and would not normally require a test to uncover, it should be answered without counting against the number of questions that the tested character can ask. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, the person asked the question should indicate why it is not answerable and it will not count against the number of questions that the character can ask. Players, if your gamemaster allows you to ask any question but you're not sure what to ask, \"What questions should I ask?\" can be a solid question to ask, since learning the right questions to ask is a crucial step in information gathering. Gamemasters, if this is a question that is somehow unanswerable, make sure you have an answer as to why and how it can become answerable. Good Tests A test of ability is fundamentally useless without a goal , a risk , and an uncertainty . Without uncertainty, the narrative already clearly indicates what will happen, so it should just happen. Without a goal, the roller's agency is subverted-- if they don't know what they're trying to do, the number rolled doesn't mean anything to them. Without a risk, failure has no cost and the test is drained of tension. At best, it's boring-- at worst it's frustrating. This is not to say that tests need always be dramatic or life-changing-- changing the lettering of a sign to prank a party member is as valid a goal as crossing a dangerous chasm and getting caught in the middle of defacing a street sign is just as valid a risk as losing your grip on a precarious bridge. The concept of goals and risks is something that relies on the players being immersed in their character, their surroundings, and the world at large. If you're playing with a bunch of people new to the system, take some time in an introductory dungeon to help your players think in terms of the goals they want to perform and the risks that might come with them. Goal Guidelines Goals are a statement of intent and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. Gamemasters, this is the part of skill checks that fall on the players to define. You should be prepared to ask questions until you are absolutely certain of the intention of the player's actions. If a player doesn't know what they are trying to do in the situation, the gamemaster should present some options like you might find in a choose-your-own-adventure novel. Risk Guidelines Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as taking a chainsaw to the chest, and should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night or missing a crucial detail.","title":"Tests of Ability"},{"location":"basics/tests/#tests-of-ability","text":"Whenever a character attempts to do something with a goal in mind, a risk present, and an uncertainty of whether either or both will happen, the gamemaster will call for a test of ability to determine what happens next.

A character can have any number of the same type of advantage or disadvantage, as long as the content of those advantages or disadvantages do not overlap. For instance, Jordan's character cannot have an Infamy disadvantage for murdering a popular duke, and also have a Major Secret disadvantage for murdering that same duke. However, Jordan's character could have two Major Secret disadvantages, one for murdering a popular duke and another for stealing a king's fortune. The Advantages Authority Rank 1 - 3 A character with an Authority advantage has some form of authority over people within their race or community. A character with an Authority worth 1 point typically either holds a minor role within their race or a major role within a small community. A character with an Authority worth 2 points usually either has a moderate role within their race or a major role within a moderately sized community. A character with an Authority worth 3 points typically holds is a major role within their race. Contacts Rank 1 - 5 A character with a Contacts advantage has some kind of group or person looking after them and concerned for their well-being. Contacts worth 1 point are typically friendly towards the character, but will not go out of their way for the character's happiness- though they may reduce prices and the like. Contacts worth 2 points will fight for the character, but if the going gets tough they will retreat, as their own survival is more important to them. Contacts worth 3 points, however, will put their life on the line for the character. Contacts worth 4 points are fairly powerful and seek to protect the character, even at the cost of their own life. Contacts worth 5 points are obscenely powerful and will always protect the character, if able. Cultured Rank 1 A character who has the Cultured advantage is very knowledgeable about a specific culture such that they might know many unusual facts about them. A character with the Cultured advantage typically knows enough about the culture that they always observe the correct customs and get along well with members of that culture. Equipment Rank 1 - 5 A character with an Equipment advantage has procured a piece of equipment from a previous adventure, as a family heirloom, or something else of that nature. An Equipment worth 1 point is typically ordinary or not very useful. An Equipment worth 2 points is a well crafted piece or somehow uncommon. An Equipment worth 3 points is unique or particularly rare. Equipment worth 4 points is particularly unique or powerful, and Equipment worth 5 points is something that could only ever be acquired by the character, and is abundantly powerful. Any Equipment worth 4 points and above hold a precious place in its owner's heart, making it nearly impossible to be lost by the owner. In campaigns where magic is present, Equipment of this rank or higher often are magically tethered to their owner, and cannot be moved any more than a small distance away from them. Natural Equipment Rank 1 - 5 The Natural Equipment advantage is similar to the Equipment advantage, but instead of procuring equipment, the character with the Natural Equipment advantage is bestowed with some form of equipment that is built into their body. Claws, wings, and gills are all prime examples of natural equipment. This convenience comes at a cost, however, as most characters with Natural Equipment require specially crafted armor to enable them to use their natural equipment without it being obstructed. A Natural Equipment rank 1 is mostly cosmetic, with only limited application in the character's day-to-day life. A Natural Equipment rank 3 has the equivalent functionality of a piece of equipment that could be bought or manufactured. A natural equipment rank 5 is highly unique to the character, and features prominently in the character's day-to-day life. Extranormal Sense Rank 2 - 3 The Extranormal Sense advantage is either major or minor. A major Extranormal Sense is worth 3 points and grants a quasi-magical form of a sense, such as the ability to see using the grounds reverberations or x-ray vision. A minor Extranormal Sense is worth 2 points and grants a more natural, but still impressive, enhancement to a sense, such as natural night vision or the ability to track using scent. Fame Rank 1 - 3 A character with a Fame advantage has performed some act of universal approval that has garnered them a positive reputation. A character with a Fame worth 1 point is surrounded by a general feeling of good will by most, if not all, when their true identity is revealed. A character with a Fame worth 2 points has performed some kind of minor act recognized everywhere, and will likely be recognized for their act via free meals and the like if their true identity is revealed. A character with a Fame worth 3 points has performed some kind of major service, and will most likely be protected from harm by the common people if their true identity is revealed. Form Alteration Rank 1 - 3 By use of the Form Alteration advantage, a character can magically shift their form into another form. A Form Alteration worth 1 point is typically a minor transformation, 2 points typically is a moderate transformation, and 3 points is a major transformation. If you are using the Earth: The Forgotten Times races, regular Gauntians have Form Alteration worth 1 point, Nexagaunts, Vampires, Succubi, and dire Gauntians have Form Alteration worth 2 points and Faeries have Form Alteration worth 3 points. Photographic Memory Rank 2 The Photographic Memory advantage is fairly simple; if the character with it has seen something, they can most likely recall it in details that others cannot easily. Pet Rank 1 - 5 The character has a pet! Simply put, the Pet advantage gives the character a pet that is worth an amount of points in proportion to how helpful their pet might be, where 1 is relatively unhelpful and 3 is very helpful. Pets that are worth 4 or more points are typically magical, in addition to being helpful. The Disadvantages Environmental Allergy Rank 1 - 3 A character with an Environmental Allergy disadvantage is allergic to something in their environment, like rust, pollen, sunlight, mold, or some other such environmental factor. Generally, a character with an Environmental Allergy worth 1 point is discomforted by the allergen, causing non-fatal damage and distraction. A character with an Environmental Allergy worth 2 points is generally incapacitated by being affected by their allergen, and a character with an Environmental Allergy worth 3 points will likely die if they come into contact with their allergen. Your GM may alter the amount of points this disadvantage is worth depending on the rarity of the allergen and the ease of treatment available. Cultural Ignorance Rank 1 A character with a Cultural Ignorance disadvantage is not very knowledgeable about a specific culture (A culture is any of the main headings in the races page). Often, they unreasonably hate or fear that culture, due to warped truths that have been passed down through their family. They will be inclined to distrust members of this culture, as well as likely have racist sentiments regarding to that culture. Obligation Rank 1 - 5 A character with an Obligation disadvantage has some form of Obligation to another character or group of characters which they must fulfil. Generally, a character with an Obligation worth 1 points has a short term and unimportant task or responsibility that they are obligated to do. A character with an Obligation worth 2 points has either a long term or important task or responsibility that they are obligated to do. A character with an Obligation worth 3 points has an obligation that is both long term and important. For Obligations above 3, the Obligation is important and also magically or mentally reinforced to such a degree that the character would receive massive repercussions should they not perform the Obligation. For an Obligation worth 4, the character may be forced to perform the task/take on the responsibility regardless of their moral or mental capacities, but have a certain level at which they can resist it, but for an Obligation worth 5, what they are Obligated to do is completely irrefutable. Your GM may alter the amount of points this disadvantage is worth depending on the difficulty of the Obligation. Enemy Rank 1 - 5 Somewhere along the line, a character with an Enemy disadvantage made an enemy, and that enemy will likely show up to confront the character multiple times during the RP. A character with an enemy worth 1 point generally has someone who sees the character as their rival and wishes to beat them, but otherwise doesn't seek them much harm. A character with an enemy worth 2 points generally has their enemy constantly showing up to thwart their plans. It's unlikely that a 2 point Enemy would want to kill the character, however, as they have much more fun watching their plans fall apart. An enemy worth 3 points is out for blood, and will stop at nothing to try to kill the character. An enemy worth 4 points is some form of very powerful enemy that wants the character's head. An enemy worth 5 points is obscenely powerful and wants to kill the character. Due to the nature of an enemy of worth three and above, the character will likely flee from them until they are powerful enough to face them. Infamy Rank 1 - 3 A character with an Infamy disadvantage has performed some act of universal despise that has garnered them a negative reputation. A character with an Infamy worth 1 point is surrounded by a general feeling of animosity by most, if not all, when their true identity is revealed. A character with an Infamy worth 2 points has committed some kind of minor atrocity recognized everywhere, and will likely be arrested if their true identity is revealed. A character with an Infamy worth 3 points has committed some kind of major atrocity, and will most likely be hunted down and killed if their true identity is revealed. Major Secret Rank 3 A character with a Major Secret disadvantage has something that must be hidden from the rest of their party members, and from everyone they meet. If their secret is revealed to any individual, they will likely constantly be paranoid about that character giving away their secret and will do anything in their power to keep the secret from getting out. Mental Disorder Rank 1 - 3 A character with a Mental Disorder disadvantage has some form of mental ailment that plagues them. Generally, a Mental Disorder worth 1 point is a trivial mental disorder and a Mental Disorder worth 3 is a debilitating mental disorder. Some examples are: hoarding, being paranoid, being a kleptomaniac, having object attachment, compulsively lying, compulsively being honest, having obsessive compulsive disorder, having authority issues, and having pyromania. Your GM will dictate how much your Mental Disorder is worth. Dependency Rank 1 - 3 A character that has the Dependency disadvantage desires some specific thing whenever it is available. A character with a Dependency worth 1 has a strong desire to obtain what they are dependent on, and will seek it out at any given opportunity. A character with a Dependency worth 2 points has a compulsion to obtain what they are dependent on, and will seek it out even if forbidden to do so. A character with a Dependency worth 3 points requires what they are dependent on to live or function, and will attempt to gain hold of it by any means possible. Phobia Rank 1 - 3 A character with a Phobia disadvantage is unreasonably afraid of something. A character with a Phobia worth 1 point generally has an extreme aversion to their phobia, and will trigger their innate fight or flight responses. A character with a Phobia worth 2 points will likely not willfully near phobia, and if confronted by it will always flee. A character with a Phobia worth 3 points typically becomes incapacitated or hostile to allies when confronted by their phobia. Physical Disorder Rank 1 - 3 A character with a Physical Disorder disadvantage has some form of physical ailment that plagues them. Generally, a Physical Disorder worth 1 point is a trivial physical disorder and a Physical Disorder worth 3 is a debilitating physical disorder. Some examples are: inappropriate expression, mysophobia, narcolepsy. Your GM will dictate how much your Physical Disorder is worth. Disfigurement Rank 1 - 3 A character with the Disfigurement disadvantage has had a substantial amount of bodily harm inflicted upon them, so much so that it has left some lasting damage. A character with a Disfigurement worth 1 point probably has some major scarring. A character with a Disfigurement worth 2 points is somewhat functionally impaired in the affected area. A character with a Disfigurement worth 3 points typically is missing a reasonable chunk of their body, such as a loss of a limb. Sense Impairment Rank 2 - 3 A character with a Sense Impairment disadvantage can have it one of two ways; the Sense Impairment is either worth 3 points and representative of a loss of a sense (Blindness, deafness), or worth 2 points and is partial loss of a sense.","title":"Advantages and Disadvantages"},{"location":"character/advantages_and_disadvantages/#advantages-and-disadvantages","text":"Advantages and Disadvantages are a way of giving a character's past a meaningful impact on their present by describing their past circumstances and the consequences of their past actions as a series of benefits and detriments.

Contacts worth 2 points will fight for the character, but if the going gets tough they will retreat, as their own survival is more important to them. Contacts worth 3 points, however, will put their life on the line for the character. Contacts worth 4 points are fairly powerful and seek to protect the character, even at the cost of their own life.

An Equipment worth 3 points is unique or particularly rare. Equipment worth 4 points is particularly unique or powerful, and Equipment worth 5 points is something that could only ever be acquired by the character, and is abundantly powerful. Any Equipment worth 4 points and above hold a precious place in its owner's heart, making it nearly impossible to be lost by the owner.

That said, gamemasters, you should read this as well-- it might even be good to read it aloud to your players at the table. Creating a character is all about dreaming up a concept, then figuring out how to realize it mechanically. There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character. If you're new to roleplaying games in general, consider writing a quick answer to the questions below as you build your character. What are your natural abilities? All characters have intrinsic attributes about them that make it easier or harder for them to do specific things. Read up on attributes , then choose either to rank your attributes or spend creation points . If you chose to rank your attributes , order your attributes from what your character should be best at to what your character should be worst at. Set your best attribute to level d12 and your second best attribute to level d10. Then set your worst attribute to level d4, and your second worst attribute to level d6. Finally, set the remaining two attributes to level d8. If you chose to spend creation points , you get a pool of 12 creation points to spend on the starting die levels of your attributes. A d4 is 0 points, a d6 is 1 point, a d8 is 2 points, a d10 is 3 points, and a d12 is 4 points. How much stress can you handle? Once you've done that, it's time to calculate your character's maximum damage. Read up on stamina , then calculate your maximum damage by adding 48 to the best possible value you can roll on your character's brawn die. Maximum Stamina = 48 + best possible roll on brawn die What have you learned? Everyone has a variety of abilities that they have learned over time through practice. Read up on skills and backgrounds , then choose to either make a background or start brimming with potential . If you chose to make a background , write a background that summarizes the skills your character has learned so far. If you chose to start brimming with potential , your gamemaster will allot you with a starting pool of 15 points of potential to spend on skills as you progress. Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish, just make sure you always offer 15 points of potential per background should a player opt to not make a background. What is your story? Motivations and experiences define characters in ways that no natural or learned ability possibly could. Each player should consider where in the campaign world they come from, and why they are seeking out to adventure with their fellow players. Read up on advantages and disadvantages and pick a few to help develop your character's history further. A character can have any amount of Advantages and Disadvantages so long as the total ranks of character's advantages is equal to the total ranks of the character's disadvantages. What do you have with you? How the players determine what items their characters have with them is largely up to their gamemaster. In a typical campaign it would not be uncommon for a character to get a full set of armor, a primary weapon, an assortment of whatever things their character might have with them \"on a typical day\", and an assortment of items related to their current pursuits. A tomb explorer would likely have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, a grappling hook, and other such necessities. A starship diplomat, on the other hand, would likely have things like a universal translator, fine clothes, id card, hologram computer, a wax seal kit, a handful of fountain pens, a sheaf of paper, and other sophisticated items. From bedrolls to mp3 players, what a character might carry with them in their day-to-day is telling of personality, circumstances of life, and so many other things. Consider also carrying an object of personal significance to your character, such as a an old, handwritten journal or a locket carrying an irreplaceable lock of grey hair. What do you look like? Describe your character! What's their heritage? Are they young or old? Thick or scrawny? What color skin? Eyes? Hair? What colors of clothing do they wear? How does their equipment look on them? Is it shiny and new? Dingy and poorly cared for? Ill fitting? Tailor-made? Be sure to pick a defining visual characteristic or two that highlights their history or personality. What is your name? Now that you know everything about them, what kind of a name fits your character? Do they use their full name or a nickname? Do they know their family name? Are they proud of it? Alternatively, you can choose a name early and use that to help figure out answers to other questions!","title":"Creating a Character"},{"location":"character/creation/#creating-a-character","text":"Character creation is intrinsically a player-focused activity, so this section will assume that the person reading it is a player.

Skills represent the individual trained abilities and backgrounds represent broad mastery gained by combining several mastered skills together. Honing your Skills A character's proficiency with the skills they know is represented by a die; four sided through twelve sided. The more proficient a character is with a skill the higher the die level of the die in question. A character who has a d4 in a skill is considered to understand the bare minimum, where a character who has a d12 in a skill is considered to have mastered that skill. If you're not familiar with the concept of die levels you can read about them here . As stated in character creation , characters in Simply Roleplaying can start anywhere from seasoned adventurers to fledgling recruits, brimming with potential. Potential is a measure of your character's ability to learn new skills or grow existing skills, given a competent teacher and time to learn. During character creation , the gamemaster will allot all of their players with a standard amount of potential to start the game with. Additional potential is earned at the end of every session . Spending Potential Players can spend potential in one of two ways: either by being trained in a skill by a more experienced character or by experimenting on their own and gaining insight in a skill. In either case they can choose to either learn the skill if they did not already know it, writing it down as a d4 skill on their character sheet, or level up the skill, increasing the die level of the skill by 1. Training Training is an intense period of study that characters can engage in over a period of several hours of downtime , given either a trainer or suitable materials to study from. At the conclusion of the training , as long as it was not significantly interrupted, the potential is spent and the character learns or levels up the trained skill. A character can act as a trainer for a skill provided that they have either mastered it or it pertains to one of their backgrounds. Gaining Insight At any point after determining the result of a skill check, a player may declare that their character has gained insight in either a skill that was used for that check or in a skill that could have been used for that check. When they do this, they may either learn or level up the trained skill. Mastering a Skill When you level a skill up to d12, you've mastered it and can't level it up anymore. If you want to get more skilled in this area, you'll have to create a background with the skill. Forgetting a Skill Sometimes a skill might not work out for your character. Maybe it was too specific, just isn't very useful in the long term, or your character has had a shift in priorities such that the skill no longer makes sense for them. In that case, you can always choose to forget . During any period of downtime , you may decrease the die level of one of your skills to reclaim one point of potential, representing your character losing interest in or forgetting about that skill in preparation to learn something new. Building a Background Once a character has three related d12 skills, they can take a few hours of downtime to reflect and combine them together to form a background that summarizes the aspect of the character that is reflected by those three skills. Backgrounds can be added to any test that their name implies that they would be useful for and are worth a d12 when added to a test. A character had mastered the skills Acrobatics , Lockpicking , and Sneaking , it would make sense for them to be able to combine them together into a background called Thief , since all of those skills are the kind a Thief might have. When a character develops a new background, the skills combined into that background are erased from their character sheet, as their new background includes those skills. That is not to say that skills combined into a background cannot be learned again, however-- if they are, those skills represent additional expertise beyond what the character already has from their background. Leveling up Backgrounds If a character has three d12 skills that are related to one of their existing backgrounds, instead of creating a new background they can choose to level an existing background up. Higher leveled backgrounds can be used multiple times on a test, up to a number of times equal to their level. To level up a background, a character takes a few hours of downtime and erases the three related d12 skills, just like when creating a background. Then, they rename the background to represent the expertise gained and mark down the new level of the background. A roguish character with a Thief background has mastered Dexterity, Sneaking , and Traps . These skills all are relevant to the Thief background so rather than add a new background they choose to level up their existing background. These skills represent their abilities beyond being a thief, so they rename their background to Master Thief (Level 2) . Renaming a Background Characters change. Getting better at the stuff your backgrounds reflect can be easily shown by creating new backgrounds that represent the new skills you've learned. However, sometimes it makes sense for the name of a background to change to better reflect the character that it's representing. A Bloodthirsty Warlord may become a Repentant General , an Assassin for Hire may become a Silencer of the Court , or a Master Blacksmith might become the Silversmith of Ardent . Sometimes the change is less story driven and more that you've come up with a better name to describe that grouping of skills. That's fine too! Backgrounds should be renamed until you're happy with them. After all, backgrounds exist to express your character. Skill and Background Naming Guidelines As you may have already figured out, skills are almost entirely determined by the players; there is no master list of skills. This means the sky's the limit as far as creating a skill or background goes. While some modules-- like the Simply Combat module --may define specifically named skills and backgrounds that have specific requirements or capabilities, a skill can usually be anything you train at-- from Juggling to Basket Weaving -- and backgrounds are even more freeform. The trickiest part about being able to create your own skills or backgrounds is coming up with a good name. You want your names to keep a balance between the general and the specific. Ideally, your skills and backgrounds should both be expressive of what you want your character to be able to do while still remaining general enough that they can come up a lot in play. Don't worry too much about coming up with the perfect name for a skill or background. It's good enough to just create a good name. Skills ultimately exist to be mastered and turned into backgrounds and backgrounds should be renamed until they feel right. Naming a Good Skill Names for skills are fairly rigid. Skills should describe a specific thing that your character has trained in. The more general the name of a skill is, the more generic the character's expertise is considered to be. A character with a History skill would be able to apply it to broad questions about the past of a town, but wouldn't likely be able to apply that knowledge to find the age of the ancient catacombs under the town like a character with an Archeology skill. Conversely, a character with an Archeology skill wouldn't likely be able to apply it to uncovering facts about the recent political unrest of the town. Naming a Good Background Names for backgrounds are more freeform. A good rule of thumb is to name your background something that you might use in a sentence to describe your character. Backgrounds could be jobs like Blacksmith , Hacker , or Guerilla Sniper , roles like Healer , Tactician , or Tank , or even quick descriptions like Born in a Port City , Penny Pincher , or Iron Will . Really, there's not much of a definition for what a background can or can't be; if it sums up both an aspect of your character and a spectrum of skills, it's probably a good background! Additional Skill/Background Examples Here are some additional examples of skills based on a attribute they work well with, and some background examples of how they might be combined. While skills are never limited by what attribute you use them with, sometimes thinking about what attribute you want to improve will help you decide on what kind of skill to learn. Skills to augment Agility tests primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are Acrobatics , Rubix Cube Solving , and Sneaking . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Criminal Mastermind . Skills to augment Brawn tests primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples are Breaching Doors , Lifting , and Swimming . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Military Commando . Skills to augment Intuition tests primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples are Driving , Gambling , and Streetwise . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Getaway Driver . Skills to augment Knowledge tests primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples are Bandit Culture , Political History , and Sewing . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Gang Savvy Granny . Skills to augment Presence tests primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples are Animal Handling , Bluff , and Political Appeal . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Druid Politician . Skills to augment Will tests primarily focus on a character's ability to shut out distractions or act despite hardship. Some examples are Acting under Pressure , Ignoring Pain , and Spirit . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Force of Nature .","title":"Skills and Backgrounds"},{"location":"character/skills/#skills-and-backgrounds","text":"Where attributes represent the intrinsic attributes of a character (their strength, speed, etc.), skills and backgrounds represent the training and expertise that same character has gained over time.

Consult your GM to make sure that you are using magic rules from this module! Unlike in many tabletop RPGs, magic is not a list of predetermined spells with various effects. Instead, in the Simply Magic module of the Simply Roleplaying system magic is the ability of the caster to reshape reality, from manipulating the thoughts of others to sending a bolt of fire streaking through the air. Because of this, magic is described by what it manipulates. Much like how the Simply Roleplaying system describes a Zwiehander as a Large Slashing weapon, a staff from which a mage produces flame would be described as Large Fire catalyst here. Catalysts Harnessing magical power is exceptionally difficult to do and requires a substantial amount of time, focus, and mental preparedness from the user. In the heat of combat and on the spur of the moment, magic users often do not have the time nor mental aptitude to instantly be able to put themselves into that mindset. In order to combat that difficulty, it is common practice for a magician to use an object specifically crafted to be a conduit to magical energy, called a \"catalyst.\" These objects are no simple matter to create, and though some cultures use the creation of such an object as a \"coming-of-age\" ritual, typically these objects would be bought or sold similar to weapons. It is often impractical for the crafter to make and sell one catalyst for each of the myriad types of magic. To avoid this, most crafters will instead create the catalyst in a \"blank\" state that is receptive to all forms of magic and sell that. A magician could then take this blank catalyst and spend a few hours with it to attune it to their particular type of magic. Catalysts, just like weapons, come in one of three sizes. Small catalysts tend to be insignificant in size and are also designed to be particularly easy for the caster to use, so that their caster might be able to use multiple at once. However, due to their ease of use and general size, small cataylsts cannot channel the same amount of power, and are individually not able to do as many things with whatever magic they may be attuned to. Large catalysts, on the other hand, cannot be used in tandem with other catalysts, but have a significant amount more power and flexibility than small catalysts. Medium catalysts lie somewhere in the middle of the road, striking a balance between the ability to wield multiple styles of magic and being proficiently powerful in each. Catalysts follow many of the rules of physical weapons for their respective sizes, but use the rules of magic described here to determine their accuracy, potency, and damage. Spells conjured in general work like ranged weapons with a set up range of 45m and a maximum range of 500m. Styles of Magic Magic comes in one of three different styles: Physical - the manipulation of physical matter or forces, Mental - the manipulation of thoughts or emotions, and Covenant - magic that doesn't strictly come from the user. Each of these utilize a unique pair of stats to determine successful manipulation. For Physical magic, the combination is Intuition and Knowledge. For Mental magic, the combination is Charisma and Intuition. For Covenant magic, the combination is Knowledge and Charisma. Physical Magic Accuracy stat: Intuition Potency stat: Knowledge Physical magic is the art of manipulating physical matter and forces, referred to henceforth as an \"element.\" An element can be virtually any force or form of matter. Just make sure you talk to your GameMaster to make sure they're comfortable with you choosing that element, remember that they have final say on what elements are available to be wielded in their world. Wielders of physical magic, through inner force of will and complete understanding their element's place in nature, are able to warp the very fabric of reality itself to match what they see. Because much of physical magic is feeling the flow of the element, mages who have a high Intuition stat will have an easier time controlling the element that they manipulate and directing it where they need it to go. It is for this reason that Intuition is used as the base stat for Accuracy checks with physical magic. Due to the necessity of understanding the complexities of whatever matter they choose to manipulate, it behooves most physical magic users to have a strong Knowledge stat. This will help them hone their magic into a stronger form, and is used as the base stat for Potency checks with physical magic. Physical magic catalysts are treated as the appropriate low power elemental damage weapon when unempowered, and the appropriate high power elemental damage weapon when empowered. Some examples of elements that a caster might manipulate are: Fire , from lighting torches to raging bonfire Metal , iron, steel, brass and lead all bend for you like clay Magnetism , how does it work? Smoke , choking clouds of cinders Electricity , call down the wrath of the skies Mental Magic Accuracy stat: Charisma Potency stat: Intuition Mental magic is the art of the caster imposing their will upon others, specifically in a way so as to manipulate a specific emotion or aspect of the target's personality, henceforth referred to as a \"mental trait.\" When manipulating an emotion, the mage can exaggerate or reduce its significance but it's important to note that a mental mage cannot cause someone to feel the inverse of their emotion. A mage who specializes in Happiness mental magic could reduce their targets happiness to virtually nothing, but they cannot use that power to make them feel sad. Though such sudden changes in mental traits may be a clear tell that a novice caster is messing with your mind, an adept mental magician will be subtle enough to force their target to reconcile their sudden change. Be sure to talk to your GameMaster about which mental trait you wish to manipulate to confirm that it's okay with them. Charisma, a stat used to measure the force of the Caster's will, is extremely important for any mental mage to use if they are to impose their will upon others. It is for this reason that Charisma is used as the base stat for Accuracy checks with mental magic. However, though a strong will is paramount to manipulate another's mind, it is equally important to have finesse with mental magic. Most individuals can shake impulsive thoughts that they can reason against, so it is important for a mental magic user to carefully link the sudden change in the targetted trait to logical sources. Doing so proficiently will enable the mental magicians changes to stay in place for longer and requires a high Intuition stat. For this reason, Intuition is used as the base stat for Potency checks with mental magic. Some examples of traits that a caster might manipulate are: Fear , the amount of times one picks flight over fight Happiness , the amount of enjoyment derived from activities Agreeableness , the openness to new ideas or suggestions Neuroticism , how prone to negative emotions someone might be Extraversion , how outgoing or sociable an individual might be Covenant Magic Accuracy stat: Knowledge Potency stat: Charisma Covenant magic is the art of a magician making a pact with one or more other magical entities in order to share power and accomplish feats beyond just themselves. This network of power is referred to as a Covenant, and is invariably founded by a group of individuals who hold similar beliefs. Unlike with Mental and Physical magic, the caster of Covenant Magic rarely dictates everything about the form of the magic produced, instead covenant itself produces a magic that reflects the beliefs of their members through the caster. In this way, covenant magic can manifest in a form that would fall under the category of physical magic or manifest in a form that would fall under the category of mental magic. This is not to say that a caster of covenant magic does not have any say over what happens, but rather that the covenant magic itself has a bit of a will of its own. A good example of this is with the magic from the followers of Magnusancte, the god of judgement who is often heralded by brilliant light. Some examples of covenant magic from the followers of Magnusancte would be: manifesting golden shackles to lock up a prisoner, calling a bolt of lightning down to smite an unworthy wretch, and making an opponent quake in fear before the presence of Magnusancte. However since Magnusancte is considered to be such an incredibly brilliant and important god, using his powers to, say, conjure a puny globe of light to light the way into a dark room would be blasphemous and likely would not work. Since covenant magic can only manifest in a way that represents the beliefs that it is created from, expert covenant magicians must have complete understanding of the beliefs that their covenant represents. Such understanding allows the caster to precisely manifest and utilize the magic gained from their covenant, and is the reason why Knowledge is the base stat for Accuracy checks with covenant magic. Due to the networked nature of the power granted by covenant magic, often the power is distributed based on individual need at the moment. For this reason, the stronger a will a mage has the more power that they can draw from their covenant. It is for this reason that Charisma is used as the base stat for Potency checks with covenant magic. Covenant magic catalysts that produce physical effects are treated as the appropriate low power elemental damage weapon when unempowered, and the appropriate high power elemental damage weapon when empowered. Some examples of covenant magicians are: Followers of Magnusancte , whose magic is brilliant and judges both the victim and the wielder Paladins of the Cleansing Flame , a covenant who work to burn evildoers. It's said their flame has no effect on the pure of heart Servants of Petraxan , the continental god from the Deus pantheon. It is said that their magic can move mountains Beneficiaries of the House Floras , whose anima, Floras, grows fruit that are said to have healing properties Purple Hexadivinites , who are said to be able to channel the power of Pureum to dispel any magic","title":"Using Magic"},{"location":"extras/magic/#using-magic","text":"The Simply Magic module is an optional ruleset for a GM to add Magic or other Extranormal abilities to their campaign.

Small catalysts tend to be insignificant in size and are also designed to be particularly easy for the caster to use, so that their caster might be able to use multiple at once. However, due to their ease of use and general size, small cataylsts cannot channel the same amount of power, and are individually not able to do as many things with whatever magic they may be attuned to. Large catalysts, on the other hand, cannot be used in tandem with other catalysts, but have a significant amount more power and flexibility than small catalysts. Medium catalysts lie somewhere in the middle of the road, striking a balance between the ability to wield multiple styles of magic and being proficiently powerful in each. Catalysts follow many of the rules of physical weapons for their respective sizes, but use the rules of magic described here to determine their accuracy, potency, and damage. Spells conjured in general work like ranged weapons with a set up range of 45m and a maximum range of 500m.","title":"Catalysts"},{"location":"extras/magic/#styles-of-magic","text":"Magic comes in one of three different styles: Physical - the manipulation of physical matter or forces, Mental - the manipulation of thoughts or emotions, and Covenant - magic that doesn't strictly come from the user. Each of these utilize a unique pair of stats to determine successful manipulation. For Physical magic, the combination is Intuition and Knowledge. For Mental magic, the combination is Charisma and Intuition. For Covenant magic, the combination is Knowledge and Charisma.","title":"Styles of Magic"},{"location":"extras/magic/#physical-magic","text":"Accuracy stat: Intuition Potency stat: Knowledge Physical magic is the art of manipulating physical matter and forces, referred to henceforth as an \"element.\" An element can be virtually any force or form of matter. Just make sure you talk to your GameMaster to make sure they're comfortable with you choosing that element, remember that they have final say on what elements are available to be wielded in their world. Wielders of physical magic, through inner force of will and complete understanding their element's place in nature, are able to warp the very fabric of reality itself to match what they see. Because much of physical magic is feeling the flow of the element, mages who have a high Intuition stat will have an easier time controlling the element that they manipulate and directing it where they need it to go. It is for this reason that Intuition is used as the base stat for Accuracy checks with physical magic. Due to the necessity of understanding the complexities of whatever matter they choose to manipulate, it behooves most physical magic users to have a strong Knowledge stat. This will help them hone their magic into a stronger form, and is used as the base stat for Potency checks with physical magic. Physical magic catalysts are treated as the appropriate low power elemental damage weapon when unempowered, and the appropriate high power elemental damage weapon when empowered. Some examples of elements that a caster might manipulate are: Fire , from lighting torches to raging bonfire Metal , iron, steel, brass and lead all bend for you like clay Magnetism , how does it work? Smoke , choking clouds of cinders Electricity , call down the wrath of the skies","title":"Physical Magic"},{"location":"extras/magic/#mental-magic","text":"Accuracy stat: Charisma Potency stat: Intuition Mental magic is the art of the caster imposing their will upon others, specifically in a way so as to manipulate a specific emotion or aspect of the target's personality, henceforth referred to as a \"mental trait.\" When manipulating an emotion, the mage can exaggerate or reduce its significance but it's important to note that a mental mage cannot cause someone to feel the inverse of their emotion. A mage who specializes in Happiness mental magic could reduce their targets happiness to virtually nothing, but they cannot use that power to make them feel sad. Though such sudden changes in mental traits may be a clear tell that a novice caster is messing with your mind, an adept mental magician will be subtle enough to force their target to reconcile their sudden change. Be sure to talk to your GameMaster about which mental trait you wish to manipulate to confirm that it's okay with them. Charisma, a stat used to measure the force of the Caster's will, is extremely important for any mental mage to use if they are to impose their will upon others. It is for this reason that Charisma is used as the base stat for Accuracy checks with mental magic. However, though a strong will is paramount to manipulate another's mind, it is equally important to have finesse with mental magic. Most individuals can shake impulsive thoughts that they can reason against, so it is important for a mental magic user to carefully link the sudden change in the targetted trait to logical sources. Doing so proficiently will enable the mental magicians changes to stay in place for longer and requires a high Intuition stat. For this reason, Intuition is used as the base stat for Potency checks with mental magic. Some examples of traits that a caster might manipulate are: Fear , the amount of times one picks flight over fight Happiness , the amount of enjoyment derived from activities Agreeableness , the openness to new ideas or suggestions Neuroticism , how prone to negative emotions someone might be Extraversion , how outgoing or sociable an individual might be","title":"Mental Magic"},{"location":"extras/magic/#covenant-magic","text":"Accuracy stat: Knowledge Potency stat: Charisma Covenant magic is the art of a magician making a pact with one or more other magical entities in order to share power and accomplish feats beyond just themselves. This network of power is referred to as a Covenant, and is invariably founded by a group of individuals who hold similar beliefs. Unlike with Mental and Physical magic, the caster of Covenant Magic rarely dictates everything about the form of the magic produced, instead covenant itself produces a magic that reflects the beliefs of their members through the caster. In this way, covenant magic can manifest in a form that would fall under the category of physical magic or manifest in a form that would fall under the category of mental magic. This is not to say that a caster of covenant magic does not have any say over what happens, but rather that the covenant magic itself has a bit of a will of its own. A good example of this is with the magic from the followers of Magnusancte, the god of judgement who is often heralded by brilliant light. Some examples of covenant magic from the followers of Magnusancte would be: manifesting golden shackles to lock up a prisoner, calling a bolt of lightning down to smite an unworthy wretch, and making an opponent quake in fear before the presence of Magnusancte. However since Magnusancte is considered to be such an incredibly brilliant and important god, using his powers to, say, conjure a puny globe of light to light the way into a dark room would be blasphemous and likely would not work. Since covenant magic can only manifest in a way that represents the beliefs that it is created from, expert covenant magicians must have complete understanding of the beliefs that their covenant represents. Such understanding allows the caster to precisely manifest and utilize the magic gained from their covenant, and is the reason why Knowledge is the base stat for Accuracy checks with covenant magic. Due to the networked nature of the power granted by covenant magic, often the power is distributed based on individual need at the moment. For this reason, the stronger a will a mage has the more power that they can draw from their covenant. It is for this reason that Charisma is used as the base stat for Potency checks with covenant magic. Covenant magic catalysts that produce physical effects are treated as the appropriate low power elemental damage weapon when unempowered, and the appropriate high power elemental damage weapon when empowered. Some examples of covenant magicians are: Followers of Magnusancte , whose magic is brilliant and judges both the victim and the wielder Paladins of the Cleansing Flame , a covenant who work to burn evildoers. It's said their flame has no effect on the pure of heart Servants of Petraxan , the continental god from the Deus pantheon. It is said that their magic can move mountains Beneficiaries of the House Floras , whose anima, Floras, grows fruit that are said to have healing properties Purple Hexadivinites , who are said to be able to channel the power of Pureum to dispel any magic","title":"Covenant Magic"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/overview/","text":"Earth: The Forgotten Times Pangeans Pantheons Earth: The Forgotten Times is set on the earth before the time of the tower of Babel, with the erection of the tower of Babel being fact and the ending of the time period that all stories within Earth: The Forgotten Times.

The story goes that there were but a handful of families of humans and each was offered a gift by the elements that made up the world. What they received transformed the entire family into something new and great, and they went forth and spread across Pangea. The final family asked for nothing, but worried that the families who had so changed would forget about their shared roots. The elements offered them a gift not simply for them, but for all of the humans-- the gift of a magically shared language. No matter how different the humans became, they would always be able to understand one another. Gradually, these variations on humanity earned names for themselves to represent the gift that so shaped their lives. When children are born from parents of different gifts, they may take on one, the other, or a unique mixture of both gifts. As a result, there's no telling whether this is a complete list of the original gifts that were given-- there may yet be more varieties of humans out there with new and strange gifts. This page is currently under construction and may contain inaccurate references to old material. Dwarves These short, gray-skinned humanoids spend most of their lives underground, building huge underground cities and basing their economy around whatever they can mine. They are solitary pangeans that prefers to spend time among itself and have a deep reverence for stone and dirt. Dwarves have perfected the ability that they call \"life forging\", a combination of blacksmithing and magic that allows a group of dwarves gathered together to, when they perform the correct rites, take the soul of a near-dead dwarf and bind it into an object, creating a magical artifact that the near-dead dwarf can live in. Due to the near holy reverence that Dwarves give to stone, nearly all objects created this way are hewn from a single piece of stone. Depending on the rites performed the object can perform any variety of actions, but is typically limited to telepathically aiding and communicating with the person that is wielding the weapon. Elves The idea of a beautiful creature so aligned with nature that it might have been there from the beginning almost spells 'Elf' in its description. Pangeans generally classified by their tall, slender appearance, and their uniquely shaped ears, the unique Elven facial structure is frequently quoted as being 'eerily beautiful.' Elves naturally grow to anywhere between 1.68-1.93 meters tall, and are frequently considered underweight for their height. Elves always have a particularly fair complexion, and have the natural array of human hair colors. Their facial structure is particularly angular, and they almost exclusively have almond-shaped eyes and tapered ears. Their distinctive and aesthetically pleasing appearances belie the natural Elven inclination to be obsessed with beauty. Most Elves are so wrapped up in appearing fair that they will surpress the urge to display emotions at the risk of marring their beauty. Many Elves have become so focused on it that they tend to be prejudiced against individuals who they don't consider to be 'beautiful'. This often leads Elves to be exceptionally selective with breeding and are not inclined to accept Half-Elves (those Elves sired in part by another pangean) into their midst due to their percieved impurity. This obsession with beauty also drives many Elves to experiment with modifying the world and its denizens with magic. If the world were to recognize them for what they were, it would be stunned by how frequently Elves were the culprit of it's favorite mythical creatures. The Elves are known for being reclusive, hiding themselves away in clusters of hidden cities referred to as the 'Elven Lands'. The Elves operate on a meritocracy, a government of officials selected on the basis of their individual ability. As such, it's not uncommon for Elven cities to feature prominently displayed Thieves guilds since they reason that if someone was stolen from, they could not protect the stolen property adequately and therefore didn't deserve to own it in the first place. Elven culture is firmly rooted in nature. Everything from their city names to their drinks tend to have names pertaining to trees or various plants or trees. Some of the largest Elven cities have a resident pair 'Grovemothers' or 'Grovefathers' who serve as the head of the community and commune with the surrounding trees and nature. The Elven lands are also filled with mysticism, with numerous areas reserved for 'Trials' or 'Rituals'. Religiously, most Elves tend to be Hexadivinites. Faeries Apart from the slight hue change in their skin tone, Faeries appear in nearly every way identical to elves, but still somehow fall short of the beauty of the elves when compared. However, unlike Elves, the Faeries are heavily aligned with magical elements. Each Faerie has an alternate form that they can switch to, comprised of the element they are aligned to. While in this state, the Faerie is unable to communicate with anything not made up of that element and cannot access any of the items they had previously on them, before they transformed. They are still normally susceptible to nonmagical attacks, but can remove wounds from themselves by absorbing nearby objects and elements of their elemental alignment, such as a campfire for fire, rocks for earth, and ice for water. Additionally, while in their elemental state, the Faeries' innate magic potential is doubled. Fae Fae are the light aligned, yellow hued Faeries, and are the most organized of the Faeries. The Fae settle in large groups around anywhere with lots of reflective materials and in warm climates, as close to the sun as they can get. There are very few Fae cities, but those that do exist are large and ancient, covered in elaborate carvings and beautiful architecture. Fae who wander outside of their cities yearn for the comfort of being within those walls, and often will be searching for a way to take residence in the nearest one. Gnomes Gnomes are the earth aligned, orange hued Faeries, and are the strongest, most independent of the Faeries. Gnomes generally do not settle together, but rather go their separate ways to seek their fortune in the world. They rarely journey across the sea, however, because they cannot stand not having solid ground under their feet. When Gnomes do settle together, they create elaborate underground cities that grow in size and complexity as more Gnomes settle in the city. Nymphs Nymphs are the water aligned, blue hued Faeries, and are the most intelligent of the Faeries. Nymphs form small tribes near bodies of water and prize knowledge more than everything else. The love of knowledge is an incessant call, so Nymph are constantly nomadically traveling from place to place to learn what they can learn. Nymph's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair typically silky white or grey. Nymph tribes often cross each other's paths and trade goods and knowledge from which both tribes benefit, and Nymph caravans will often visit other pangeans in caravans to speak with them. Salamanders Salamanders are the fire aligned, red hued Faeries, and are the most charismatic of the Faeries. Much like Nymphs, Salamanders nomadically travel in caravans and only settle temporarily in places. Salamanders are arguably the most nomadic Faeries, simply because they travel for the sole purpose of conversing with other pangeans and having new experiences. Salamander's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair is typically silky black or grey. It is not unheard of for Salamanders to split away from their caravans and find a new life in a city their caravan visits, should they find the place particularly enthralling. Sylphs Sylphs are the wind aligned, green hued Faeries, and are the quickest of the Faeries. Sylphs are often known to be carefree and whimsical, a product of that sort of behavior being encouraged in their culture. Sylphs believe that physical swiftness or mental acuity are the best possible trait for any to cultivate. Due to this love of adaptability, Sylphs are nomadic like Nymphs and Salamanders. It is not uncommon for Sylph tribes to consist of a single family living in strange and harsh locations. Gauntians Gauntian pangeans have an innate magical ability born from closeness to a specific type of animal; the ability to shift into an animal form. Each Gauntian has its own unique limitations to their transformation that governs what they can become, but generally they can transform at any time over the space of one round (no other actions may be made when transforming). Transforming is dangerous, too. Gauntians that stay in their animal form for too long are stuck in that form and cannot get out of it. Trapped Gauntians will slowly lose their sentience until they relapse into the mindset of a wild animal. Aerogaunts Aerogaunts are a tribal society who can transform into birds. An aerogaunt can only become one kind of bird, and will display physical characteristics relating to that bird. Common physical characteristics are patches of feathers on their body around their neck and head, often blending with the hair on their head. Anomalies that can transform into multiple birds do exist, though they are rare. Talk to your GM if you want your character to be one of these anomalies. Aerogaunts typically gather together and form tribes, much like their bird forms would flock together. Most Aerogaunts can transform into a regularly sized bird, and cannot stay in their animal form for more than 24 hours or be trapped. These Aerogaunts retain their normal stats while transformed, but cannot transform into anything larger than 1.5m tall. There are, however, Aerogaunts that can transform into larger birds and larger forms of birds. These Aerogaunts are known as Dires, and transform into birds whose height tends to maintain their pangean height, regardless of the size of the original bird. Aquagaunts Aquagaunts are a Gauntian that can transform into sea animals. They are similarly limited to Solumgaunts in size. More will be added here in the future. Solumgaunts Solumgaunts are essentially the same thing as Aerogaunts, but with a few differences; they too are a tribal society who can transform, but they can transform into land animals. Like Aerogaunts, Solumgaunts can only become one kind of animal and display features relating to that animal; usually patches of fur or scales along their neck, a tail, and the ears of the animal that they transform into. Anomalies that can become more than one kind of animal do exist, albiet as a rarity. Talk to your GM if you want your character to be one of these anomalies. Solumgaunts typically gather and form tribes much like their animal forms would. Most Solumgaunts can transform into a regularly sized land creature, and cannot stay in their animal form for more than 24 hours or else they'd be trapped. These Solumgaunts retain their normal stats while transformed, but cannot transform into anything larger than a lion. There are, however, Solumgaunts who can transform into larger animals and larger forms of animals. These Solumgaunts are known as Dires, and can transform into animals whose forms nearly double in length to their pangean form's normal height. Nexagaunts Nexagaunts have developed the ability to transform into a hybrid between their animal and human state, rather than a full animal state. These hybrid states tend to be about a foot larger than the Nexagaunt's pangean form. Sasquatch The 2 meter tall Sasquatch are fairly easy to distinguish from other forms of Giants because of the thick layer of brown, white, or black fur that covers their body. Most Sasquatch view clothing as \"unnecessary fur\", so seeing a Sasquatch with even rudimentary clothing is a rarity. Sasquatch tend to dwell in hutted tribes or in caves, often traveling in groups of less than a dozen. Ogres If bad feelings are felt towards Sasquatch, far worse feelings are felt towards their slightly taller (usually around 225 cm tall) cousins, Ogres. Ogres are generally considered to be more human due to the fact that they are not covered with fur and are typically wearing clothing, but considered far less human due to their tendency to be cannibalistic. Ogres believe that in order to grow stronger, one must devour the flesh of their opponent directly after defeating the opponent. Trolls Trolls are huge. That's pretty much the first reaction everyone has when encountering them. Among Ogres and Sasquatch, Trolls look the least like other pangeans, with an appearance like a giant hairless sloth. Most Trolls are stocky to withstand the harsh, cold tundras that they're often found in, and stand an impressive 2.5m tall. Humans Averaging just under 2 meters tall, humans represent what is common between all pangeans. The term humanoid is often used interchangeably with pangean, and humans often have a way of using the common tongue in ways that other pangeans cannot. Mer Mer are similar to most pangeans in size with gills positioned behind their ears and under their jaw. Additionally, Mer have a thin and extremely durable sheath of scales that can be used to bind their legs together into a seamless tail for quick swimming underwater, not unlike that of a fish. Deep Ones Deep Ones are ancient beings of the water that dwell on the ocean floor. Their bones are thinly coated in muscle, and chunks of seaweed and coral is often stuck to their limp, slick green skin. They are amphibious, and have much love of water and the creatures that reside therein. Unfortunately, Deep Ones have difficulty communicating with other pangeans, as they never developed a mouth. As a result, they communicate telepathically and have an innate affinity with magic. They have both lungs and gills, and can use either at will. Regardless of this fact, they must remain hydrated in the same way that vampires must feast on blood, so they tend to prefer the comforting wetness of the briny deep. Goblins Short, a bit spindly, with large hooked noses Goblins tend to have pale skin with a hint of green instead of the typical red flush to their skintone. Most stand around 1.5 meters tall and are notoriously spontaneous. Their culture will often create sprawling camps that have multiple layers of walls, simply because they created the first camp with exactly enough space for everyone and dealt with the subsequent population booms with an equal amount of foresight. They do not build things to last and are known to periodically move to a new home because they were bored of their previous one. Orcs Pale skin with an ever so slightly green tint to it, wild black hair, and heavily muscled bodies are some of the first impressions that most have when encountering Orcs. As tenacious as they are intimidating, Orcs tend to be courageous and can endure even the most painful of hardships, sometimes even as well as fiends. Orcs are among the most honest people that anyone may encounter, something which comes as both a blessing and a curse, as they can easily enrage other pangeans whose diplomatic relations requires more \"tact.\" They form tribes of reasonable sizes and prefer to create their camps out of proof of their strength, such as hide huts from hunting and such. There are many Orc cities made out of stone, but most Orcs settle in tribal encampments. Djinn Djinn are pangeans whose gift transforms their entire body into a swirling mass of energy. They are similar to revenants, but far more stable as they were transformed by their gift. Fiends Fiends are a proud, towering, obsidian-skinned pangean with antler-like horns sprouting from their brow. In their own language, there is no word for a distinction between the different pangeans, merely a difference in strength. In their own tongue, they are \"strong ones\" -- an appropriate name when one considers their naturally developing muscles and over 2 meter average height. A fierce, proud pangean, the Fiends are the founders of the Kol'lukt religion, and most Fiends are practitioners of that religion. Changeling Changelings were the exact same as Fiends at one time, but disliked their heavily muscled form-- preferring instead the beauty of the other pangeans. Their desire to mimic the other pangeans prompted magical interference with their own genetic makeup, eventually allowing them to shift their physical features at will into seamless replicas of others (This does not change the Changeling's stats). Changelings are genderless, and often change their gender and racial appearance at will. Revenants Revenants are often referred to as being \"undead\", but such a term is a broadly incorrect categorization of what revenants truly are. Revenants are magic users who have had their lifespan extended by the binding of their soul to organic material through magical bonds, somewhat similar to the Dwarven method of \"life forging\". When a creature is born, their soul is tethered to their body by a cord of life energy; when they die, that cord breaks. Revenants are created by gluing the cord back on with magic, albiet crudely. The most pressing concern with being a Revenant is that their skin and bones cease growing and only deteriorate, requiring them to constantly graft new parts onto themselves. While newly created Revenants look pretty much exactly how they did when they died, older ones have been known to look more than a little bit creepy, with parts grafted where they do not naturally appear. Because they are created with a magical tether, revenants can be killed with a forcible enough disenchantment. Vampires Vampires are a broad class of pangean that are most commonly associated with bats. It is unknown from whence their origin comes, but it is speculated that High Vampires spread the disease among some kind of bat-like animal that, over the generations, became more pangean, resulting in the birth of the first Hellpire. The theory further states that Cave Vampires came from the crossbreeding of the Hellpires and other pangeans. Cave Vampires Cave Vampires live in the crypts of large, usually abandoned structures. Cave Vampires are most commonly recognized by their sunken eyes, bat-like wings that sprout out of their backs, and their deceptively bony muscular build. Hellpires Hellpires are possibly the most feared form of Vampire. Living almost exclusively in caves, Hellpires are much like High Vampires in that they usually appear as a regular humanoid. However, this is not because of a mastery of changing themselves, but rather an innate ability to project a humanoid shape and sized illusion of themselves. When their illusion has been dispelled (whether by themselves or by a magic user of a high enough skill), they appear as gigantic humanoid bats approximately 3 meters tall. High Vampires When a High Vampire bites another pangean, they have the ability to seal away another pangean's gift and replace it with High Vampirism, though other vampires and Revenants are immune to High Vampirism. Blending in seamlessly with their surroundings, High Vampires look exactly like they once did, and can change their facial and bodily features at will with innate magic. However, they cannot change their particularly long canines that develop upon being bitten.","title":"Pangeans of the Forgotten Times"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#pangeans-of-the-forgotten-times","text":"There's a story that goes back ages about the first humans that lived on the supercontinent of Pangea.

Dwarves have perfected the ability that they call \"life forging\", a combination of blacksmithing and magic that allows a group of dwarves gathered together to, when they perform the correct rites, take the soul of a near-dead dwarf and bind it into an object, creating a magical artifact that the near-dead dwarf can live in. Due to the near holy reverence that Dwarves give to stone, nearly all objects created this way are hewn from a single piece of stone. Depending on the rites performed the object can perform any variety of actions, but is typically limited to telepathically aiding and communicating with the person that is wielding the weapon.","title":"Dwarves"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#elves","text":"The idea of a beautiful creature so aligned with nature that it might have been there from the beginning almost spells 'Elf' in its description. Pangeans generally classified by their tall, slender appearance, and their uniquely shaped ears, the unique Elven facial structure is frequently quoted as being 'eerily beautiful.' Elves naturally grow to anywhere between 1.68-1.93 meters tall, and are frequently considered underweight for their height. Elves always have a particularly fair complexion, and have the natural array of human hair colors. Their facial structure is particularly angular, and they almost exclusively have almond-shaped eyes and tapered ears. Their distinctive and aesthetically pleasing appearances belie the natural Elven inclination to be obsessed with beauty. Most Elves are so wrapped up in appearing fair that they will surpress the urge to display emotions at the risk of marring their beauty. Many Elves have become so focused on it that they tend to be prejudiced against individuals who they don't consider to be 'beautiful'. This often leads Elves to be exceptionally selective with breeding and are not inclined to accept Half-Elves (those Elves sired in part by another pangean) into their midst due to their percieved impurity. This obsession with beauty also drives many Elves to experiment with modifying the world and its denizens with magic. If the world were to recognize them for what they were, it would be stunned by how frequently Elves were the culprit of it's favorite mythical creatures. The Elves are known for being reclusive, hiding themselves away in clusters of hidden cities referred to as the 'Elven Lands'. The Elves operate on a meritocracy, a government of officials selected on the basis of their individual ability. As such, it's not uncommon for Elven cities to feature prominently displayed Thieves guilds since they reason that if someone was stolen from, they could not protect the stolen property adequately and therefore didn't deserve to own it in the first place. Elven culture is firmly rooted in nature. Everything from their city names to their drinks tend to have names pertaining to trees or various plants or trees. Some of the largest Elven cities have a resident pair 'Grovemothers' or 'Grovefathers' who serve as the head of the community and commune with the surrounding trees and nature. The Elven lands are also filled with mysticism, with numerous areas reserved for 'Trials' or 'Rituals'. Religiously, most Elves tend to be Hexadivinites.","title":"Elves"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#faeries","text":"Apart from the slight hue change in their skin tone, Faeries appear in nearly every way identical to elves, but still somehow fall short of the beauty of the elves when compared. However, unlike Elves, the Faeries are heavily aligned with magical elements. Each Faerie has an alternate form that they can switch to, comprised of the element they are aligned to. While in this state, the Faerie is unable to communicate with anything not made up of that element and cannot access any of the items they had previously on them, before they transformed. They are still normally susceptible to nonmagical attacks, but can remove wounds from themselves by absorbing nearby objects and elements of their elemental alignment, such as a campfire for fire, rocks for earth, and ice for water. Additionally, while in their elemental state, the Faeries' innate magic potential is doubled.","title":"Faeries"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#fae","text":"Fae are the light aligned, yellow hued Faeries, and are the most organized of the Faeries.

Nymph's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair typically silky white or grey.

Salamanders are arguably the most nomadic Faeries, simply because they travel for the sole purpose of conversing with other pangeans and having new experiences. Salamander's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair is typically silky black or grey.

Animus Worshipper Title: Beneficiary Deities in Pantheon: Lunis , Father of Endings Sola , Mother of Beginnings Innumerable other Anima Creation of the World The Animus believe that the Arch-Anima are benevolent beings that created the world from lifeless scrap that existed in the universe. The Animus believe that both the universe and the Arch-Anima have always existed and always will exist, with or without their believers. The Animus pledge their lives to their \"benefactors\" as a sign of showing respect for the gift of life they were given. The End of the World The Animus believe that the universe and the Arch-Anima will always live forever, and as such have no thoughts on the end of the world beyond the fact that some day there will not be any Animus left to worship the Arch-Anima, prompting the Arch-Anima to create new life. The Deities' Role in the World The Anima believe that upon an area or grouping of people being consecrated by a priest of the Animus, a personal Anima will be created by the power of the Arch-Animi to watch over the consecrated location or individuals. Consecration is a high honor, and is typically only done if the group of people or the place is extremely important in the eyes of the Animus. Worship Practices Because Anima are created for specific locations or individuals, worshiping them is simply paying respect for their job. This can be done in any way the Animus determines, but is usually accomplished through feats of labor such as creating or maintaining a shrine or preparing regular offerings. It is generally believed that the more work done to honor the spirit, the more the worship is worth. What Makes a Priest Becoming a priest of Anima requires that the Animus who wishes to become a priest take a pilgrimage back to the original shrine of Sola in a valley in Eurasia, followed by a dangerous trek through a mountain pass to the original shrine of Lunis. At both shrines, an elder priest records the Animus' entrance and provides mentorship for the Animus. The Animus becomes a priest if they are deemed worthy by both mentors. The Afterlife The Animus do not believe in life after death -- instead, they believe their souls are absorbed back into the Arch-Animus from whence they came. Court of Celestials Worshipper Title: Celestate Deities in Pantheon: Primordial entities (not traditionally worshipped, but forces revered to hold great power) The Darkness The Light The Sisters of Radiance Avaria , Archangel of Justice and Trial Zeriate , Archangel of Protection and Divine Retribution Collete , Archangel of Ingenuity and Expression Gabrielle , Archangel of Law and Order Teviyas , Archangel of Good Will and Harvest Euriel , Archangel of Truth and Wisdom Serenia , Archangel of Peace and Prosperity The Sisters of Shadow Lilith , Archangel of Violence and Calamity Morrigan , Archangel of Temptations and Misery Creation of the World Celestate believe that the universe is the realm of Light. When the Light formed the universe, its radiance created nine Archangels known as the Court of Celestials to govern it from the Celestial Terrace. However, when the creation of sentient beings began, the Court began to disagree. Lilith and Morrigan jointly proposed the idea that all creatures should serve the council, and swayed Avaria and Gabrielle. However the other Angels, championed by Serenia and Collete, rejected the proposal claiming it \"Against the will of the Light.\" Sneering at their sisters, Morrigan and Lilith bided their time, drawing power from the Darkness to amass an army of Dark Angels and attacked the Celestial Terrace in an attempt to seize control. They were driven back by the forces of Avaria and Zeriate and sealed within the realm of the Darkness. To separate themselves from those whom they banished, the remaining seven archangels named themselves the Sisters of Radiance, sworn to the will of the Light. Meanwhile, instead of being defeated by their new prison, Morrigan and Lilith swore themselves to the will of the Darkness and named themselves the Sisters of Shadow. They used their new powers to manipulate the realm to create the Nether Sphere, a dominion which was their own twisted world. Teviyas abhorred the conflict between all of her sisters and attempted to convince the Sisters of Radiance to reform the Court, including the Sisters of Shadow. The Sisters of Radiance initially refused, but as cracks began to form between the realm of the Light and the realm of the Darkness, releasing all a manner of horrors. The Sisters of Radiance were only able to seal the rifts from the realm of the Light, leaving weakened barriers that could be torn back open quicker than the Sisters of Radiance could seal them. Teviyas out of pity and desperation went alone to the Nether Sphere to implore the Sisters of Shadow to help seal the rifts and rejoin the Court. To win their favor, Teviyas offered Lilith and Morrigan rule over the creatures of the realm of Light who strayed from the Light's will and the two reluctantly agreed to rejoin the Court. The Sisters of Radiance had little choice but to accept the Sisters of Shadow's return as their help from within the realm of Darkness permanently sealed the rifts between the two realms. The Court was reformed with renewed purpose to keep watch over where the barriers between the realms were weakest, but the universe is a vast place. Reluctantly, the Court agreed to allow the Sisters of Shadow to create all manner of afflictions to test mortals, that they might prove themselves to be worth the Court's protection. The End of the World The Order neither believes that any apocalypse is imminent, nor that the Darkness is completely evil. However, an offshoot known as the Templars believes Lilith and Morrigan are forming up an army in the Nether Sphere to take over the world. There are other, smaller, denominations of the Celestate who embody different interpretations of the Council's will, but they are of negligible importance. Speak to your GM if you would like to be a part of an offshoot. The Deities' Role in the World The Court primarily stays out of the affairs of the world. However, each Archangel is a guardian of an important virtue, and may affect the morals and events based around these virtues. Worship Practices Worshippers gather in a church and pray to the Court, singing their praises and asking for their guidance. Lilith and Morrigan are rarely worshiped, but when they are it is in an ancient, cult-like manner. What Makes a Priest Priests must go through schooling in which they focus on interpreting the will of a specific Archangel. The Afterlife Those who die and live a virtuous life become housed within the Council's halls, ruled over and protected by the Archangel which they most associate with. Those who do not become void spawn, the mindless servants of Lilith and Morrigan. Cults of the Twin Sisters of Shadows believe that the most loyal among them will become Dark Angels through a process called \"The Calling,\" which would allow them to keep their free will to more adequately serve Lilith and Morrigan. Deus Worshipper Title: Servant Deities in Pantheon: Magnempus , Deus of Storms Stelsolis , Deus of Stars Petraxan , Deus of Mountains Aequosa , Deus of Tides Iracun , Deus of Emotions Vitima , Deus of Life Noxorte , Deus of Death Astrus , Deus of Cunning Fata vel Fortuna , Deus of Luck Imperiadas , Deus of Order Berutum , Deus of Creatures and Freedom Sylvas , Deus of the Forests Creation of the World Those who follow the Deus pantheon believe that the world was created and every Deus born at the same time. As the world grew, so did the Deus-- for they were the world, and controlled its development. As the years rolled by, eventually they grew lonely with their power in the world. As the Deus grew more and more, they tried to fill the void they felt, accidently setting into motion the creation of the pangeans. Although this creation was accidental, the deities felt a new sense of purpose and responsibility and vowed to watch after this new life they created. The End of the World The Deus believe that the Gods are not immortal, but rather that they simply live for an incredibly long time. When the Gods start to die, the Deus believe that the world will begin to unravel. Similarly, any harm caused to the world is seen as harm caused to the Gods themselves. The Deities' Role in the World The Gods are the world, they alone prevent it from falling apart. Since the Gods are the world, they may intervene as they choose within their realm of expertise to protect those who worship them. Worship Practices Each Deus has no definitive gender, though when they manifest they may choose a gender for the avatar that represents them. As such, it's very common for a Deus in one era depicted as one gender to suddenly be depicted as a different gender in another era. Traditionally, each of the deities are worshipped separately in their own temples with massive gatherings to celebrate what the Deus stands for. Unlike most other pantheons, each Deus is viewed as separate entities and are worshipped separately. What Makes a Priest Priests of the Deus specialize in their knowledge of the teachings of individual Gods, however they are also expected to understand and respect the customs of other priests that worship the other Gods of the pantheon. A priest-to-be must make a pilgrimage to a temple of each of the Gods and be trained by an elder there, then return to the temple of their patron deity for special training before they are acknowledged as a priest of their deity. The Afterlife Deus believe that after death, their souls are taken to the underworld by Noxorte, where they spend their time reliving their life from others who experienced contact with the deceased Deus at any point in the Deus' life. This begins with the deceased themselves. Hexadivinus Worshipper Title: Hexadivinite Deities in Pantheon: Aurantiaco , Lord of the Orange Robe Elder God of Emotional and Physical Strength Associated with earth Caesitas , Lady of the Blue Robe Child Goddess of curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge Associated with water Luteus , Lord of the Yellow Robe Middle-aged God of elegant and purposeful order Associated with light Pureum , Lady of the Purple Robe Elder Goddess of elegant and purposeful chaos Associated with darkness Rutilun , Lord of the Red Robe Child God of emotional passion Associated with fire Viren , Lady of the Green Robe Young goddess of seduction, playfulness, and whimsy Associated with air Creation of the World All six of the the Lords and Ladies gathered together and worked together (for the first time) to create the universe and all therein as an elaborate environment for them to experiment on and play with. It is believed that they will not ever work together again until the end of the world. The End of the World Once the six are done with the universe, they will destroy it as their second collective action. The Deities' Role in the World The six desired a relatively infinite realm of mirrors of themselves (in different parts), and thereby created the universe, that they might live together as a family in practically infinite ways and places, experiencing practically everything. A piece of each god is in everyone, so the only way to grow as an individual is believed to be that you must praise them all. Amongst them, Rutilun cannonically pursues Viren and Caesitas, both goddesses whom he cannot have- wooing them with every power at his disposal, but ultimately failing each and every time. Luteus and Pureum play an incredibly large and extravagant version of chess constantly, and Aurantiaco watches them all, and simply observes the other five's antics, stopping them from ruining the universe, should any of the five do something extreme. Worship Practices Worshippers are expected to find their inner god/goddess, whichever one calls to them the most- and live out their life in praise to that god/goddess primarily, and the other five secondarily. The gender of the god/goddess has nothing to do with the gender of the individual who is called to live out their life (A woman could have her inner God be Rutilun, etc.). What Makes a Priest Priests are often defined as the best representatives of each lord and lady that are within the society- they are expected to act as much like the lord/lady they represent as they possibly can, from acting out legends to acting on only impulses that are thought to be from their specified god. The Afterlife Since each life is actually just one of the lords/ladies' lives, it is expected that they will join their inner diety in the Outside, where all the Gods sit and learn about how they lived- each life telling their story to the others in a never-ending stream of stories and experiences, each as precious as the last. Kol'lukt Worshipper Title: Challenger Deities in Pantheon: Vol'Kris , the Sky's Raptor A dinosaur-like feathered creature who leaps with blinding speed Dra'kolobrum , the Grinding Oblivion A serpent with a draconic head and many rows of acid-dripping teeth Ke'tu , Maw of the Deep An enormous eel-like creature with an awful unhinging jaw Kani'tres , the Voracious Flame A molten cerberus Invus , the Final Gatekeeper A terrifying combination of the previous four creatures, depicted in myriad ways Creation of the World Each individual has their own universe \"created\" when they are born as their own personal battlefield. Everything therein exists only to test them and make them stronger for the aftermath, when they will face the five colossi to determine their final resting place in the afterlife. The End of the World Each individuals universe ends as soon as they die, since they no longer need it for training. The possibility of the end of the creation and destruction of individuals is largely unexplored- as a kind of a... \"who cares\" sort of question. The Deities' Role in the World The colossi's only role in the world is to keep the challengers flowing at them, perhaps from instinct or perhaps to some inscrutable end. Challengers of Kol'lukt view it as common sense to worship them and learn as much as they can about them so they can focus on defeating them. Worship Practices Becoming a challenge for the colossi is the ultimate form of praise to them. Challengers welcome any form of strengthening themselves or putting themselves to the test, and often duel each other to this end. What Makes a Priest There are few priests of Kol'lukt, since most practitioners view the world as specially made for them to become stronger and see little point in sharing their beliefs with others around them. The priests that do exist tend to rely on their own fighting prowess, but can call upon the strength of previous combatants to augment their capabilities. These priests, however, know that when they finally die, they will not be able to rely upon borrowed help, but will have to face the colossi alone. For this reason, priests are incredibly uncommon. The Afterlife Worshippers believe that upon their death they are sent to face the five colossi in a gauntlet to determine their final resting place. Vol'Kris is the first challenge, followed by Dra'kolobrum, Ke'tu, Kani'tres, and Invus, in that order. If defeated by any of the colossi, the challenger is believed to then serve that colossi until they deign to allow that challenger to return to the mortal world to prepare and try the gauntlet again. The worst fate that could befall a challenger in the afterlife is if a colossi judges that they are not worthy of trying again, and they remain bound in servitude forever. Defeating all of the colossi results in joining the ranks of the Champions in the outer world, feasting and fighting and living forever in bliss with the other Champions. Magnusanctus Worshipper Title: Follower Deities in Pantheon: Magnusancte Creation of the World It is believed that Magnusancte created the universe and all in it in an endeavor to find the perfect people to fill his perfect city with, an ever-expanding utopia that he will always protect and always be loved by. The End of the World Once Magnusancte wishes to retire from judging everyone and just to simply live among his subjects, the gates of his city will close and the universe outside of his perfect city will be forced to remain alone with all of the evil of the world, forever without his guidance or protection. There are no apocalypse stories in Magnusanctus because his city is believed to endure forever. The Deities' Role in the World Magnusancte has only one role in the world- to watch over it and keep track of what everyone does and how they do it. Worship Practices Magnusancte is worshipped in a church by a fairly large group of worshippers, lead by their priest. The services are largely teachings of the importance of the seven tenants on which Magnusancte will judge everyone: Purity, Gentleness, Diligence, Altruism, Steadiness, Communion, and Humility. What Makes a Priest Priests of Magnusancte are expected to study the seven different tenants with seven different teachers and dedicate their life to them. After studying under their seven mentors, the new priest is expected to go forth and teach a unique combination of what they learned, teaching others the way of Magnusancte. The Afterlife It is believed that the dead go before Magnusancte after they have died, seeking entry to his perfect city. If they pass his judgement, they will be allowed in. If they do not, they will be cast out and forced to live outside the city's walls with the evil of the world in a land of perpetual harsh conditions, natural disasters, and hordes of dangerous beasts.","title":"Pantheons of the Forgotten Times"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#pantheons-of-the-forgotten-times","text":"Legends speak of pantheons of deities that populated the Forgotten Times who granted their followers with a flow of magic through divine covenants, offering miracles for worship.","title":"Pantheons of the Forgotten Times"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#animus","text":"Worshipper Title: Beneficiary Deities in Pantheon: Lunis , Father of Endings Sola , Mother of Beginnings Innumerable other Anima","title":"Animus"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#creation-of-the-world","text":"The Animus believe that the Arch-Anima are benevolent beings that created the world from lifeless scrap that existed in the universe.

When the Light formed the universe, its radiance created nine Archangels known as the Court of Celestials to govern it from the Celestial Terrace. However, when the creation of sentient beings began, the Court began to disagree. Lilith and Morrigan jointly proposed the idea that all creatures should serve the council, and swayed Avaria and Gabrielle. However the other Angels, championed by Serenia and Collete, rejected the proposal claiming it \"Against the will of the Light.\" Sneering at their sisters, Morrigan and Lilith bided their time, drawing power from the Darkness to amass an army of Dark Angels and attacked the Celestial Terrace in an attempt to seize control. They were driven back by the forces of Avaria and Zeriate and sealed within the realm of the Darkness. To separate themselves from those whom they banished, the remaining seven archangels named themselves the Sisters of Radiance, sworn to the will of the Light. Meanwhile, instead of being defeated by their new prison, Morrigan and Lilith swore themselves to the will of the Darkness and named themselves the Sisters of Shadow. They used their new powers to manipulate the realm to create the Nether Sphere, a dominion which was their own twisted world. Teviyas abhorred the conflict between all of her sisters and attempted to convince the Sisters of Radiance to reform the Court, including the Sisters of Shadow. The Sisters of Radiance initially refused, but as cracks began to form between the realm of the Light and the realm of the Darkness, releasing all a manner of horrors. The Sisters of Radiance were only able to seal the rifts from the realm of the Light, leaving weakened barriers that could be torn back open quicker than the Sisters of Radiance could seal them. Teviyas out of pity and desperation went alone to the Nether Sphere to implore the Sisters of Shadow to help seal the rifts and rejoin the Court. To win their favor, Teviyas offered Lilith and Morrigan rule over the creatures of the realm of Light who strayed from the Light's will and the two reluctantly agreed to rejoin the Court. The Sisters of Radiance had little choice but to accept the Sisters of Shadow's return as their help from within the realm of Darkness permanently sealed the rifts between the two realms. The Court was reformed with renewed purpose to keep watch over where the barriers between the realms were weakest, but the universe is a vast place. Reluctantly, the Court agreed to allow the Sisters of Shadow to create all manner of afflictions to test mortals, that they might prove themselves to be worth the Court's protection.","title":"Creation of the World"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#the-end-of-the-world_1","text":"The Order neither believes that any apocalypse is imminent, nor that the Darkness is completely evil.
