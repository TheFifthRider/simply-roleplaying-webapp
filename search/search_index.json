There were six players, ranging from people who had lots of experience with TTRPGs to people who had only ever heard of roleplaying. At the time I was running two weekly campaigns and I was eager to play-- there was just one problem. I didn't have any of the books for the system I had been running. All I had was a single set of polyhedral dice. So I winged it. I used the d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 as the way to distribute character strengths and weaknesses, decided on five categories (Agility, Brawn, Mental, Charisma, and Luck), and had each player distribute the five dice between them. For character creation, I gave them a quick writing prompt of \"You're in prison, about to be executed. What are you accused of?\" to chew on while we played and we got to the business of playing the game -- starting with a jailbreak. The one-shot turned into a campaign and it became clear that the system worked for my players, but it needed to develop to handle progression and other elements that the longer-length nature of a campaign promised. As players asked me for systems to do certain things, I improvised ways it could be done. Whatever worked, stuck. If you asked me, I'd say the system as it is now is still a work in progress -- it's been through many revisions and there are still elements of it that I'm not happy with. However, no matter how much my art-is-never-truly-finished brain really wants to protest it, it is ready to be run by people other than me. So, here it is. If I had to say one thing about the design of my system, it's that how simple that first session was to set up and go sticks with me. No matter how much I add to the system I will always endeavor to make sure that others can still recreate that magic with their players, should they wish to. About Me \uf0c1 Hey! I'm Richard. When I was younger, I loved to tinker with the rules for any board game I played. Sometimes before I had even finished playing them through once! When I joined my parents' AD&D group, I started writing rule supplements for doing things that I thought would be cool, like overhauling the process for crafting and enchanting a weapon. I started putting pen to paper on my own games and systems in middle school. Any system I made was something that needed to be simple enough to be played on a whim at the lunch table or on a campout-- so that meant no dice or character sheets, let alone prep material. As a result, the systems I made were heavily narratively focused and had few mechanics beyond my players describing what they wanted to do and me improvising a world in response. In high school I built out a simple system with proper mechanics that was heavily inspired by Fire Emblem, and in college I started devouring other systems to learn from all the cool stuff that's out there! Outside of roleplaying games, I dig video games and I have a rather sizeable collection of board games of which I'm proud to say there are only a few that I've never played. I also \"spend a lot of time thinking about time\" as my roommate puts it-- there's something about having a good todo list and time tracker going that just really helps me keep everything in my life running smoothly.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-simply-roleplaying","text":"Simply Roleplaying started in 2013 at a friend's birthday party in college when somebody suggested I run a one-shot session.

If you're creating a character for the first time, you may want to check out the walkthrough in character creation . The content on this page and that page are almost the same, this one is just aimed at breaking everything on your character sheet down while that page is aimed at walking you through setting it up. Level \uf0c1 Your level represents, generally, how strong you are. You add this to your attributes to determine the total number of dice you can roll from your skills, legacies, and backgrounds. Health and Injuries \uf0c1 Health is how much damage you can take before you suffer an injury . Injuries take time to recover from, and if you take too many you'll be defeated . Injuries are both a box and a line describing the harm you took -- only the box matters for gameplay purposes, the text is just to remind you what happened so you know when it makes sense to recover from it. Attributes \uf0c1 Attributes are broad categories which represent your strengths and weaknesses-- your physical strength, ability to quickly respond, willpower, and more. Any time you make a test , it'll test a specific attribute and you'll add that attribute to your level to determine how many dice to roll. You also have passive attribute scores that you use instead of dice for when you respond reflexively to that attribute being tested. Skills, Legacies, and Backgrounds \uf0c1 Skills, Legacies, and Backgrounds are the individual pieces that make up who you are and what you've learned. Skills describe what you know how to do: anything concrete that you can get better at, given practice. Legacies describe your reputation: your values, the factions you've allied with, and the deeds you've done. Backgrounds describe you: they're built from Skills and Legacies put together and summarized. Abilities and Ability Points \uf0c1 Abilities are the unique and cool things your character can do. Casting magic, building inventions, or memorizing crucial details all can go here. Ability points are a pool of points that you can spend on doing cool ability stuff. Inventory \uf0c1 Your inventory is filled with all the stuff you own. Anything you can use to accomplish a task usually has tags that describe its properties. Items in your inventory are either equipped or not-- equipped items are usually visible and easy to get to, unequipped items are stored away somewhere on your person. Companions \uf0c1 Your companions are anyone else who travels with you, but doesn't need a full character sheet to represent them. A helper offers you the support of their skills. An ally has attributes, damage, and inventory of their own, but shares your level, injuries, skills, legacies, backgrounds, and abilities.","title":"What Makes Up a Character?"},{"location":"character/#what-makes-up-a-character","text":"A character in Simply Roleplaying is made up of several different pieces.

They're your magic spells, martial art forms, animal transformations, or any other cool mechanic that's specific to your character. And best of all? You decide how they work. Ability Points \uf0c1 To start with, consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do? An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of ability points . You start with a pool of 2 of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you spend some downtime to recover . You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their mana from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their ammunition in an arsenal. A leader might replenish their pride from cheering throngs of admirers. Naming and Renaming Ability Points \uf0c1 If you're not sure what you want you want your ability points to be called at the start, it's okay to just call them \"ability points\" and come up with a name for them later. Eventually, though, you will want them to have a name beacuse it helps to make the flavor of your character come to life! Similarly, you should feel free to rename your ability points if the name you chose doesn't feel right or if it no longer makes sense. Gaining Ability Points and Creating Abilities \uf0c1 Every 10 potential you earn (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two. Any number of times between sessions you can reduce your maximum ability points by 1 to learn a new ability , or reduce your maximum ability points by 2 to improve an existing ability . If you happen to have multiple pools of ability points you may reduce any one of them by 1 to learn a new ability, or 2 to improve an existing ability. You can also reduce two of them by 1 to improve an existing ability. Similarly, between sessions you can remove abilities from your character sheet if you feel like they don't belong-- whether you just don't like how they work or if you feel like they don't make sense to your character anymore. If you do, make sure you increase your maximum ability points to compensate for the points you spent to earn that ability. If you made up new abilities or improvements, it's a good idea to make sure you take some time to talk them over with your table and/or your GM before you introduce them. Advanced Actions \uf0c1 One of the easiest ways to create an ability is to power up a basic action into something more advanced. Here are some examples -- the specific ability points that power them are italicized . Attack \uf0c1 Fireball As an action, you can spend 1 mp to make an Attack with Knowledge against a target within long range and all targets within short range of them. Defend \uf0c1 Dodge and Roll When you Defend against an attack, you can spend 1 slick move to move 1 space away from the person who attacked you. If you critically succeed, you can move half your speed instead. Get Answers \uf0c1 The Dead Speak to Me As an action, you can spend 1 runed bone to roll Presence and Get Answers by speaking with the spirits of the recently departed as long as you have a remnant of them or something they cared about. Help \uf0c1 Amythest Ward By spending 1 magical gem , you can roll Knowledge to Help yourself or any ally within short range by erecting a shimmering purple barrier that wards off attacks. Hinder \uf0c1 Flashbang Grenade By spending 1 ammunition , you can roll Intuition to Hinder a target within short range by firing a flashbang from your shoulder cannon. Make Progress (On Something Big) \uf0c1 Words of Inspiration By spending 1 point of ridiculous charisma you can roll Presence to Make Progress on something you wouldn't normally be able to help with by inspiring someone else who is doing it. Movement \uf0c1 Slip past As an action, by spending 1 point of cunning , you can Move without people Reacting to your movement. Prepare \uf0c1 Ready for Anything By spending 1 scrappiness , you can roll Intuition in the minutes before a fight to Prepare for a battle with an enemy, flashing back to any tricks you may have hidden up your sleeve. Test \uf0c1 Mechanisms are My Forte By spending 1 sprocket before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade a d12 to a d20 before rolling. New Actions \uf0c1 Another way to create abilities is to make entirely new actions! Abilities can do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway. If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a test to resist the effects, setting the Difficulty (likely based on your roll or one of your passive attributes) and describing what happens if they Critically Succeed , Succeed , Partially Succeed , or Fail . Heal Somebody \uf0c1 Test a specific attribute, then heal damage from someone close equal to what you rolled. If you roll higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes. Medic Matrix As an action by spending 1 nyanobot , test your knowledge to heal that much damage from someone close. If you rolled higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes. Move an Enemy \uf0c1 Test a specific attribute against an enemy's passive attributes, then move them if you win! Grapple Gun As an action, fire your grappling hook arm at an enemy within long range to pull them in closer. Test your brawn against their passive brawn or agility. If you succeed, pull them a short distance toward you. Tag Something \uf0c1 Give yourself a tagged item for the scene, or tag parts of yourself as if they were an item. Automatically add the +1 tag at level 2, +2 at level 3, and so on up to +9 at level 10. Rockin' Abs Once per rest as a reaction, you can spend 1 muscle point to treat your 6 pack as if it was an item with the brawn and armor tags for the scene. Upgrading Abilities \uf0c1 As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either give them an extra effect or make them stronger . Combine Actions \uf0c1 Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. One way to accomplish that is by combining the effects of two basic actions into one roll! I Know The Supernatural As an action, by spending 1 firsthand supernatural experience I can roll Knowledge to Get Answers about a supernatural creature I can see. Before I roll, I can trade one of my d12s for a d20. Upgrade Monster Hunting Expert As two actions, by spending 1 firsthand supernatural experience I can roll Knowledge to both Get Answers about a supernatural creature I can see and Help myself or others by recalling how to deal with it in the same roll. Before I roll, I can trade one of my d12s for a d20. Your combined action will usually still require you to spend the same number of total actions, but now that they are one roll both benefit from any strengthening upgrades you provide. You can also combine already upgraded abilities, or actions you have that nobody else does! Divine Weapon As an action, by spending 1 faith I can give anything the +5 , blessed , will , and weapon tags. Upgrade Blessing of the Golden Ankh As two actions, by spending 1 faith I can roll Will to heal somebody by the amount I rolled. In addition, give something equipped to them the +5 , blessed , will , and weapon tags. If an ability allowed you to give an item the blessed and weapon tags, adding an extra effect might let you test your Presence to heal the wielder too! Making an Action Stronger \uf0c1 If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. One way is to trade a d12 for a d20, or increasing the number of d12s are traded into d20s. Mechanisms are My Forte By spending 1 sprocket before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade a d12 to a d20 before rolling. Upgrade Mechanisms are My Forte + By spending 1 sprocket before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade two d12s to d20s before rolling. Another way is by adding additional tags, or increasing the magnitude of those tags! Fireball As an action, you can spend 1 mp to make an Attack with Knowledge against a target within long range and all targets within short range of them. Upgrade Firestorm As an action, you can spend 1 mp to make an Attack with Knowledge against a target within long range and all targets within medium range of them. Big Abilities \uf0c1 Most abilities are going to be the kind you see above, but sometimes you just want to go bigger to summon a meteor storm or telekinetically pull a starship down from the sky. For these sorts of abilities, talk with your GM. It's possible that what you're really trying to do is to make progress on something big . If you and your GM agree that this is something you should have on your character sheet, then you should pick a way to earn it. Maybe you need to develop the ability as something smaller, and then get the big version after you've upgraded it a certain number of times. Maybe the ability costs more points of potential than a regular one. Finally, abilities get bigger and badder the more requirements you put on them. If you want a really big ability, you should attach some pretty serious requirements. Most of the time, this is at least spending downtime to prepare the big ability for action. Review requirements with your GM and pick some that make sense!","title":"Abilities"},{"location":"character/abilities/#abilities","text":"Abilities are your special moves.

If you have high Will, you're probably determined, independent, and collected in the face of hardship. Improving Attributes \uf0c1 Whenever you level up, you can increase two attributes by 1, as long as you don't increase them past your attribute cap. The attribute cap is +1 at level 1, and increases by +1 every two levels. That means the cap is +2 at level 3, +3 at level 5, and so on. Attribute Cap = level/2, rounded up Passive Attribute Scores \uf0c1 You don't always have to roll to resist risks! Whenever you are reflexively opposing a risk, your gamemaster will use one of your attribute's passive scores instead of asking you to roll the dice. For each attribute, your passive attribute score is equal to six times the total of your level plus that attribute -- the same as if you rolled all the dice you could for a test of that attribute and got a six for each of them! Passive Score = 6 x (level + Attribute) An advisor tests their Presence to manipulate their monarch by feeding them fabrications. Even though the monarch has no reason to suspect the advisor of lying, their experience in politics might tip them off. In this case, that experience is represented by their passive Presence score. The monarch is a level 4 character with a Presence of +2. Their passive Presence , and the difficulty of the advisor's test, is 6 x (4 + 2) = 36. A young wizard tries to tiptoe past their sleeping master, testing their Agility to silently swipe the master's fabled wand, risking getting caught red handed and getting turned into a newt or worse . Because the master is asleep, the difficulty of the test is the master's passive Intuition score-- how likely the master's instincts are to wake them up from the noises their apprentice makes.

Skills are things you've trained yourself to be good at, legacies are accomplishments and behaviors you're known for, and backgrounds summarize your character by combining several skills and legacies together. Skills and Legacies \uf0c1 Skills and legacies are dice that you will eventually collect into backgrounds. They start as d4s and can grow to be as powerful as d12. Before you roll , if you are doing something related to a background you either have or want to have, you can spend potential to write it down or level it up to the next largest die size, to a maximum of d12. You can also level up the die whenever you do something and it makes sense that you'd level up or gain a skill or legacy as a result. It doesn't really matter whether a die is a skill or a legacy, but whether it's something that you're good at or a reputation that you're known for can be helpful in determining what makes sense for how to level it up. For example, it makes sense for a player to be able to level up or gain a new skill when they spend some time training or gain a flash of insight from seeing something cool that they or somebody else did. Separately, it makes sense that a player could level up or gain a new legacy whenever they do something memorable or act like their reputation . Renaming a Skill or Legacy \uf0c1 Leveling up a skill or legacy can also be an opportunity to refine it. Whenever you level up a skill or legacy you can also rename it to better represent the skill or legacy that your character is developing. A character with the skill Spotting Traps narrowly avoids the last arrow trap of a dungeon and gains insight , spending a point of potential to level up the skill. As they reflect on how it might be less useful back above ground, they decide to rename the skill to Quick Reflexes as they level it up. A character with the legacy Wanted Pickpocket acts like their reputation and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy by formally accepting membership to the Blackgrass Thieves' Guild. Not wanting to limit themselves to picking pockets, they change the name of the legacy to Blackgrass Thieves' Guild Member . A character with the skill Research spends days trying to crack the secrets of an alien artifact, working with a librarian to help train them in getting better at researching. To represent both the newfound knowledge and to help them get more specific answers in the future, they decide to rename the skill to Extraterrestrial Research as they level it up. A character with the legacy Monster Hunter does something memorable by landing the killing blow on the dragon who has been terrorizing the countryside and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy. Since slaying a dragon is surely more impressive than the other creatures they've defeated, they decide they'd rather the legacy be named Dragonslayer . Abandoning a Skill or Legacy \uf0c1 Sometimes a skill or legacy might not work out for your character. Maybe it was too specific, just isn't very useful in the long term, or your character has had a shift in priorities such that what you wrote down no longer makes sense for them. In that case, you can always choose to forget . During any period of downtime or whenever else it makes sense you may decrease the die level of one of your skills or legacies to reclaim one point of potential. This can represent the public's waning attention to your deeds in the case of a legacy, or your character losing interest in or forgetting about that skill in preparation to learn something new. Building a Background \uf0c1 If you have at least two related d12 skills and/or legacies during downtime or any other time that makes sense you can combine them together to form a background . Similarly, if you have at least one d12 skill or legacy related to one of your existing backgrounds you can add it to that existing background. To create a background, write down a phrase that summarizes the skills and/or legacies as they relate to your character followed by the number of d12s you put into the background. Then erase the old legacies and skills -- they're part of the background now! The next time you make a new legacy or skill, you can reuse the name of one of the skills or legacies you just erased to represent additional reputations and capabilities beyond what the background describes. A character has a d12 Acrobatics skill and a d12 Robs from the rich to feed the poor legacy, they can combine them together into a 2d12 background called Robin Hood of Crookshack Row . The same character develops a d12 Thief of Luiena's Crown legacy. Since this is relevant to their 2d12 Robin Hood of Crookshack Row background, they can add a d12 to that background and rename it, turning it into the 3d12 Crownthief of Staedbergh background. Renaming a Background \uf0c1 Whenever it makes sense for the name of a background to change, you can rename it to something else. A Bloodthirsty Warlord might become a Repentant General , an Assassin for Hire might become a Silencer of the Court , or a Master Blacksmith might become the Silversmith of Ardent . Sometimes the change is less story driven and more that you've come up with a better name to describe that grouping of skills. That's fine too! Backgrounds should be renamed until you're happy with how they express your character. Naming Guidelines \uf0c1 Don't worry too much about coming up with the perfect name, it's often enough to create a good name. Skills and legacies are just the building blocks of backgrounds and backgrounds should be renamed until they feel right. That said, the trickiest part about creating skills, legacies, and backgrounds is coming up with a good name for them. Ideally the naems should be expressive of what you want your character to be able to do while still remaining general enough that they can come up a lot in play. Naming a Skill \uf0c1 Skill names should focus on a specific capability that can be learned or taught with names like Biology , Swordfighting , and Archeology . They sometimes almost sound like the names of academic courses! If you're struggling to think of a good way to name a skill, just try filling in a blank in the sentence \"I'm good at _______.\" with a phrase that describes the skill. Whatever you fill the blank in with is likely a great name for the skill! Since the way you level up your skills is by taking some time to train or gaining a flash of inspiration , be sure to think of how you'll train those skills and scenes that show how your character was able to innovate on their own based on something they saw or did. Archery can only be leveled up when you pick up a bow and arrow, but Marksmanship could be leveled from excelling at a game of darts! Naming a Legacy \uf0c1 Legacy names should focus on your character's reputation and things they've done, but should also represent the developing nature of the legacy. Legacies can be a phrase describing your displayed values, a title awarded, or anything else that showcases your budding reputation. Legacies are also a great space for representing ranks in factions-- joining any faction and advancing in rank are both definitely doing something memorable, and acting in line for that faction will always be acting like your reputation. Since the way that you level up your legacies is by doing something memorable and acting like your reputation , make sure to think about how you'll level up your legacy as you write it down! Robbed a noble can likely only be leveled up whenever you rob someone or talk about how you did, but Steals from the rich to feed the poor can be leveled up both by being a thief and whenever you perform an act of charity! Naming a Background \uf0c1 A good rule of thumb is to name your background something that you might use in a sentence to describe your character. Backgrounds could be jobs like Blacksmith , Hacker , or Guerilla Sniper , roles like Healer , Tactician , or Tank , or even quick descriptions like Outcast of Newport City , Penny Pinching Accountant , or Iron Willed Gunslinger . Really, there's not much of a definition for what a background can or can't be; if it sums up both an aspect of your character and the skills and legacies you put into it's probably a good background! Additional Examples \uf0c1 Here are some additional examples of skills based on a attribute they work well with, and some background examples of how they might be combined. While skills are never limited by what attribute you use them with, sometimes thinking about what attribute you want to improve will help you decide on what kind of skill to learn. Skills to augment Agility tests primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are Acrobatics , Rubix Cube Solving , and Sneaking . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Criminal Mastermind . Skills to augment Brawn tests primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples are Breaching Doors , Lifting , and Swimming . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Military Commando . Skills to augment Intuition tests primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples are Driving , Gambling , and Streetwise . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Getaway Driver . Skills to augment Knowledge tests primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples are Bandit Culture , Political History , and Sewing . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Gang Savvy Granny . Skills to augment Presence tests primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples are Animal Handling , Bluff , and Political Appeal . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Druid Politician . Skills to augment Will tests primarily focus on a character's ability to shut out distractions or act despite hardship. Some examples are Acting under Pressure , Ignoring Pain , and Spirit . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Force of Nature .","title":"Backgrounds, Skills, and Legacies"},{"location":"character/backgrounds/#backgrounds-skills-and-legacies","text":"Your level represents the number of dice you can roll in total on a test, but backgrounds, skills, and legacies are where you get those dice.

They go in your inventory . Playing cards, bundles of rope, your trusty blade-- it might have tags to describe its use, or it might simply be a flavorful item that may or may not have specifically codified effects. How much can your inventory hold? \uf0c1 There's not a strict limit to what you can have in your inventory-- your inventory should be able to hold everything you need, but it probably should still make sense . Unless your setting calls for a reason otherwise, it's generally assumed that you have a backpack, sapient pearwood luggage, or other inventory-management item with you to carry what you need. When in doubt, it's practical to not limit what can be in someone's inventory. Nobody wants to deal with explaining how exactly they're carrying twelve different swords in their backpack. Equipped Items \uf0c1 You can have as many things as you want to have in your inventory, but you can only benefit from what's equipped . Equipped items are things you're wearing, holding, have on your belt-- anything that you know exactly where it is and can grab it immediately in a pinch. Just like what's in your inventory, what you have equipped should make sense . Whenever you have the opportunity, often with downtime but it can be as flexible as your GM would like, you can equip and unequip items. When you're in an action scene you can use anything you have equipped without taking any time to pull it out or put it away. If they're not equipped, then you'll have to take at least one action to retrieve the items and equip them first. Your GM may say you must use multiple actions if you're trying to get out a lot of things, what you're trying to get needs assembly after being retrieved, or what you're getting is particularly difficult to get out of your portable storage. You can unequip any items necessary for what you have equipped to still make sense as a part of these actions. Similarly, if you wish to stow items for any reason in an action scene you can take at least one action to unequip them into your inventory. Just like with equipping, if it's something cumbersome or something that requires disassembly before storage your GM may say you must use multiple actions for this. Tagged Items \uf0c1 Tags describe what's important about an item: how it can be used, what benefits it provides, and anything else that matters. You can only benefit from an item's tags if it's equipped. Not every item has tags or needs them. If it's obvious how an item is used, it probably doesn't need a tag or, if it does, you can tag it in the moment. Sometimes items don't need tags until they're used in a specific way that you want to remember. In short, tag things when they need to be tagged. This is especially true for narratively important tags. An iron sword doesn't need to be tagged with iron when an adventurer picks it up, but as soon as they face something vulnerable to the metal, it should be. Using Items Improperly If you attack with something that doesn't have the weapon tag, defend with something that doesn't have the shield tag, or do something else to use an item in a way that it's not intended to be used, your GM may say there is an additional risk that the item might be damaged, destroyed, or otherwise lost and/or some tags on the item do not apply . A +5 sword might be very good at attacking, but there's no guarantee that it'd be equally as good at blocking. Tag List \uf0c1 Here's a suggested list of tags that you can use to describe the items in your game. Be sure to add more tags that are important to your setting! If you're in a dark fantasy setting hunting beasts of the night and need silvered weapons to confront them, silver should be a tag. If you're in a futuristic dystopian setting and everything legally acquired is monitored through a chip, unchipped should be a tag. +1, +2, +3, ... \uf0c1 Items with this tag are more effective than other items of the same type due to exemplary craftsmanship, materials, and/or renown. Add the tagged number to any test you make with this item. If the item's tags grant the wearer a passive value (such as armor HP), add the tagged amount. Agility \uf0c1 Items with this tag are often light, compact, or rely on manual precision to operate effectively. Bows , scimitars , sniper rifles , and pistols often have the Agility tag. Armor \uf0c1 requires: any attribute tag Items with this tag are wearable defense like personal shield generators, Kevlar vests, or full plate. When worn, armor grants the wearer with additional armor hp equal to the highest passive value of the item's tagged attributes . A character can only benefit from one set of armor at a time. Brawn \uf0c1 Items with this tag is often heavy or strenuous to operate effectively. Mauls , axes , grenade launchers , and shotguns often have the Brawn tag. Concealable \uf0c1 Items with this tag are small and easy to take out or hide. Daggers , miniature crossbows , pistols , and brass knuckles often have the Concealable tag. Focus \uf0c1 requires: a tag like Pyromancy or Telekinesis that indicates what kinds of abilities it's for An item with this tag is a tool that helps you with your abilities , like a wand for a wizard or a nyanobot array for a genetically engineered cat doctor. Pairs well with the +X tag to give you +X on tests you make with that ability. Intuition \uf0c1 Items with this tag are often foreign or complicated in inconsistent ways, requiring keen adaptability to operate effectively. Alien technology and mental magic focuses often have the Intuition tag. Knowledge \uf0c1 Items with this tag are often complicated and only able to be effectively operated by someone thoroughly trained in how it works. Mad science gadgets , ancient rituals , and physical magic catalysts often have the Knowledge tag. Large \uf0c1 Items with this tag require two hands to wield effectively. Rocket launchers , mauls , longbows , and staves often have the Large tag. Presence \uf0c1 Items with this tag might be sentient and require reasoning with to operate effectively or otherwise somehow utilize the wielder's social aptitudes. A high maintenance combat support robot , a tape recording of the maddening snores of C'thulhu , or an arcane book of physically manifesting insults might have the Presence tag. [Close, Short, Medium, Long] Range \uf0c1 The distance at which the item is able to be effectively used. Primarily used for weapons, but also useful for things like grappling hooks and ladders to represent their reach. Items can have many range tags -- if an item isn't tagged with a specific range, it's not useful at that distance. Shield \uf0c1 requires: At least one attribute tag Items with this tag are carriable defense, like bucklers, directional forcefields, and riot shields. Equipping a shield allows you to defend against an attack with the tagged attribute. Weapon \uf0c1 requires: At least one attribute tag AND at least one range tag Items with this tag are anything used to attack another character, from table legs to semi-automatic rifles. While equipped with a weapon, you can attack with one of the tagged attributes at one of the tagged ranges. Will \uf0c1 Items with this tag might be painful to operate or otherwise require and amplify the mental fortitude required to get them to work. A shard of broken glass , a covenant magic catalyst , and alien biotech integrated into a human might have the Will tag.","title":"Items and Tags"},{"location":"character/equipment/#items-and-tags","text":"Your items are your stuff.

Whenever you have the opportunity, often with downtime but it can be as flexible as your GM would like, you can equip and unequip items. When you're in an action scene you can use anything you have equipped without taking any time to pull it out or put it away. If they're not equipped, then you'll have to take at least one action to retrieve the items and equip them first. Your GM may say you must use multiple actions if you're trying to get out a lot of things, what you're trying to get needs assembly after being retrieved, or what you're getting is particularly difficult to get out of your portable storage. You can unequip any items necessary for what you have equipped to still make sense as a part of these actions.

Injuries \uf0c1 Injuries are lasting physical or mental consequence that bring you closer to defeat. You can suffer a total of three injuries before you are defeated, including the injury that defeats you. If you suffer an injury and you have an unmarked injury box, reset your health, mark the injury box, and if the line next to it is blank, write a brief description of the injury.

Defeat \uf0c1 If you suffer an injury when all of your injury boxes are marked, you are defeated . What defeated means depends on the situation, but in broad strokes it means that you've succumbed to whatever dangers you were facing.

Action scenes are exactly what they sound like -- fast paced moments that you might see in an action movie or video game. While in movies or video games, action scenes are often fast paced and happen in real time, Action scenes are turn based to allow players their space to contribute to the narrative. There are some things that are broadly applicable to all kinds of action scenes, but sometimes you may want to slightly tweak those rules to better convey the feeling of different types of scenes -- a battle will feel differently from a chase, for instance. Who Goes When \uf0c1 Since they're usually taking place in a short duration of time, everyone and everything that impacts the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking turns over the course of one 10 second round . Of course, it's possible that the length of a round may vary depending on what kind of action scene you're in -- a race around the world, for instance, might instead have rounds that take place over days or even weeks. Taking Turns \uf0c1 The following is adapted from the ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post Accidentally Designing Marvel\u2019s Action Order System which has since been removed -- linked is a reprint of the post in the FATE SRD. The first round of the action scene, figure out who made the first move. Almost every chase starts with someone bolting and almost every battle starts with someone firing the first shot. Whatever that action was, play it out and let them take the rest of their turn if they still have more to do. Then, after the first person to go has finished their turn, they must choose another character or obstacle in the scene who has not taken a turn yet this round to take the next turn. This includes characters who so far haven't contributed to the action scene, introducing them to the fray. If there's nobody left who hasn't taken a turn yet this round, congratulations! You're the last person in the round and you get the strategic advantage of being able to pick anybody in the scene to start the next one. Interrupting Turns \uf0c1 If you have an ability that lets you do it you can interrupt the turn order, taking your turn in place of whomever was originally being passed to. If you do, at the end of your turn you may choose whomever you want to take their turn next -- you don't have to pass the turn order on to the person who was originally going to take their turn. Who do I pass to? \uf0c1 At the end of your turn, you're going to be faced with a choice -- who do you want to pass to? Sometimes the answer to this is just \"who does it make sense to pass to\"? If you're having a tense 1-on-1 duel with an enemy, you might want to make your move and then pass to them to keep the back-and-forth going. Sometimes the answer is teamwork! Maybe you set up a teammate for success by creating stacks for them, or they let you know they have a great follow up for whatever you're doing. Passing to an enemy seems bad on its face, but actually has some strong tactical value. By passing to an enemy, you get to see what they'll do during the round and be more able to react to it. In addition, sometimes passing to an enemy can secure your team ending the round. Used cleverly, this can allow some key characters the opportunity to take two turns in a row-- one at the end of the round, and one at the start of the next round. GM Tips: Dealing with Action Economy with Bosses and Squads \uf0c1 As a GM, you might want to swarm the players with lots of low level mooks or pit them against one big bad boss. Since we're passing initiative around it's easy for the side with more characters to hang on to who starts the next round, which isn't always what you want! If the boss is outnumbered and you want to make them stronger, give the boss a few more turns. If that feels too strong, limit what the boss can do on each turn-- maybe they only get 2 actions per turn, or on their first turn they get their full 3 actions, but every other turn the boss has only 1 action. You can even do some cool cinematic stuff here by giving the boss an attack that hits many spaces that they spend an action on to wind up on their first turn, then spend an action to complete on one of their subsequent turns. If the players are outnumbered by low-level mooks but you don't want the strength in numbers to feel too overwhelming, try marking a group of them as a squad! Squads are simply a set of characters that will always pass their action to another character in their \"squad\" until none are available. This helps your players (and you!) so the turn can be passed to \"the bandits\" instead of needing to specify which specific bandit they're referring to. Actions \uf0c1 When it's your turn, you can take up to 3 actions . One action on its own measures something quick like making an attack, hiding behind a pillar, or triggering a mechanism. Multiple actions can be used, even across turns or rounds, to do time consuming or difficult things like pushing over a statue, disarming the security measures on a door, or reloading a siege weapon. If it makes sense characters can contribute their actions towards an effort in progress by another character. This would allow a group of three to push over a statue that requires 9 actions to topple in the span of a single round. If you're spending lots of actions to do a task you usually you can't just stop in the middle and then pick it up later. However, if somebody else lends a helping hand to your effort it usually makes sense that you can do something else and leave the rest to them. Moving Your Speed \uf0c1 Every character (and some objects) have a speed , measured in spaces. When a character uses their action to move, they can move a distance up to their speed. This movement might be sprinting, running and leaping, swimming, riding a horse, or driving a car. Your GM may say that some spaces take up extra spaces of movement if the terrain is difficult to traverse or if there's some other reason you might need to slow down when moving through it. Defining Scene-Specific Actions: Chases \uf0c1 Sometimes it can be helpful to define specific actions that can be taken in an action scene. Chases, for instance, are a special kind of action scene that capture the fast back-and-forth between participants as they race towards the goal. Because distance towards the goal is the primary focus, there are several special actions that deal primarily with that detailed here . Freeform Action Scene \uf0c1 The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when observing strict rules for an action scene would get in the way of the drama of the scene. A freeform action scene is any action scene that uses some, but not all, rules that are normally a part of an action scene. There may or may not be any defined actions or even an established turn order. This allows each character the freedom to act as would make sense to the scene.","title":"Action Scenes"},{"location":"gameplay/action/#action-scenes","text":"When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, it really matters when you can do what.

At the end of each session, read the following goals aloud: Gain a point of potential if we accomplished something new and important Gain a point of potential if we learned something important about the world, or if something important changed Gain a point of potential if we learned something important about a player character, or if something important changed Gain a point of potential if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by Discuss if you met the goal. If the players and the GM agree that you have, immediately gain one point of potential! Potential \uf0c1 Potential is a measure of your growth. You'll start with some potential during character creation , and then earn more at the end of every session. You can then spend that potential in game, after the game, and/or out of game -- depending on what your group prefers -- to improve skills and legacies , increase your character's health and specific ability points , and to gain new abilities . Spending Potential \uf0c1 You can spend one point of potential to: * Learn or level up a skill or legacy * Increase your character's health per injury by 1 You can spend two points of potential to: * Increase one of your pools of ability points by 1 * Create a new pool of ability points You can spend three points of potential to: * Learn a new ability * Strengthen an existing ability Leveling Up \uf0c1 Leveling up means more dice to use on tests! Usually, you'll level up at the end of significant story arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. Expect to level up about every 25 points of potential earned. If you're starting to feel like you're investing in skills and backgrounds that aren't very important to your character because you can't level up the skills and backgrounds that are core to your character anymore, make sure to let your gamemaster know! That's usually a sign that you need a level up. Increase Your Attributes \uf0c1 When you level up, pick two attributes and increase their bonus by 1. Just make sure you're not going past the attribute cap . Character Check-In \uf0c1 In addition to the power bump of being able to roll more dice, leveling up also provides a space for you and your gamemaster to check-in and rework any aspects of the character that just aren't working. This includes, but is not limited to: Forget any number of skills or legacies and reclaim your spent potential Rename any number of skills or legacies Invest any unspent potential on any skills or legacies you want Combine any number of d12 skills or legacies into backgrounds Rename any backgrounds you want Erase any abilities you want, and reclaim your spent points of potential Gain any number of new abilities, spending three points of potential for each Improve abilities any number of times, spending three points of potential for each Custom Goals \uf0c1 Session goals can always be changed after each session, and should always be changed if the group isn't feeling them. The goal of session goals is to create a positive feedback loop of doing the things that everyone is excited about. The more fun the session, the more potential everybody should get! Generally, you want about one goal per hour you usually play so you can aim to achieve one goal per hour you play! Session goals can be narrative goals like \"Gain a point of potential if we defeat the Bronzeridge Bandits,\" or more meta goals like \"Gain a point of potential if everyone had fun.\" Personal Goals \uf0c1 Session goals don't have to be shared-- if your group is comfortable with players having different amounts of potential, characters or players can have their own personal goals in addition to the group goals. You should reduce the number of shared goals if characters have their own personal goals, since you typically want to achieve between hours played and goals possible to achieve. Personal goals are set by each player on their own based on whatever makes sense for their character. They can be changed after each session, or whenever the player and gamemaster agree that they should be changed. Personal goals often end up being more specific than shared goals-- especially when you're still feeling out your character --but they should evolve overtime into something that speaks to your character's general behavior. Early goals like these: Gain a point of potential if you protected Wren from the brigands Gain a point of potential if you take a thieves guild job Gain a point of potential if you talk your way into the art show Can become these: Gain a point of potential if you put yourself in harms way to protect another Gain a point of potential if you skimmed a little off the top for yourself Gain a point of potential if you convinced someone to see it your way Alternatives to goals \uf0c1 If your group would rather not do goals, you can instead simply gain a specific amount of potential every session.

Attack \uf0c1 Attacking is a test of whatever attribute makes sense for the attack, usually against the roll of somebody who is defending against you! If your target cannot or does not defend, the difficulty is their passive brawn. If your target isn't a character and doesn't have passive brawn, you're actually probably making progress . When you test an attribute to attack someone , if you... Fail: Your target either takes half damage or no damage at all, depending on how well the defender rolled. Partially succeed: Your target takes damage equal to your roll. Fully succeed: Your target takes damage equal to your roll. Critically Succeed: Your target takes damage equal to twice your roll. Defend \uf0c1 If somebody attacks you, you can try to defend against the attack and turn it into a contest of their attack roll and whatever attribute you're defending with. You can also defend against an attack targeted at someone else as long as it makes sense , but you will take any damage they would have taken. When you test an attribute to defend against an attack , If you... Fail: You take damage equal to the attacker's roll, or equal to double the attacker's roll depending on how well they rolled. Partially succeed: You take half of the attacker's roll as damage . Fully succeed: You take half of what the attacker rolled as damage . Critically succeed: You take no damage. Get Answers \uf0c1 If you're trying to answers to questions , whether it's by researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual, make a test of the appropriate attribute and then ask the GM (or the other player, if you're targeting a PC) some questions. When you test an attribute to find answers to questions , if you... Fail: You may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely Partially succeed: You may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully Succeed: You may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully Critically Succeed: You may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully If you're not sure what to ask, \"What questions should I ask?\" is always a good question. It counts towards the number of questions you get, but hones in on the juicy stuff your GM might have for you to discover. It's also realistic-- it's not often that a character knows what question they're trying to answer right when they start looking for information. The answers to the questions should both make sense and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question \"Who killed this person?\" with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with \"someone with red hair and a blue cloak\" based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby. Questions cannot be wasted. If the answer to a question was already stated, it doesn't count. If the answer to a question would not normally require a test to uncover, it doesn't count. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, it doesn't count and the person asked the question should explain why it is not answerable and how to make it answerable, if possible. Help / Hinder \uf0c1 If you want to help somebody out, get yourself into a better position, or hinder an enemy, you can do that by rolling and stacking or unstacking dice based on the result. When you test an attribute to help or hinder someone , for every 10 in the total you rolled you may: Stack a die or in their favor Remove a die stacked against them Stack a die against them Remove a die stacked in their favor The dice you stack depends on what level you are: Level 1-2 : Stack d4s Level 3-4 : Stack d6s Level 5-6 : Stack d8s Level 7-8 : Stack d10s Level 9+: Stack d12s Make Progress (On Something Big) \uf0c1 If you're trying to do something and you can't do it in just one test, your GM may say that the goal of your test is to fill a progress meter in how close the task is to being done! When you test an attribute to fill a progress meter , fill it by the amount that you rolled! Move \uf0c1 Move a short distrance to get where you need to go. You may need to test an attribute to get there if it's hard or dangerous to get to. Prepare \uf0c1 When a character takes some downtime and makes a test of any attribute with a goal to prepare for a situation , stack a flashback die. Then, for every 20 in the total you rolled, you may stack another flashback die. The dice you stack depends on what level you are: Level 1-2 : Stack d4s Level 3-4 : Stack d6s Level 5-6 : Stack d8s Level 7-8 : Stack d10s Level 9+: Stack d12s Test an Attribute \uf0c1 When you test an attribute and none of the other basic moves make sense, if you...

Think of a necromancer fleeing as the tide turns against his undead minions, an archeologist braving the ocean to be first to reach an ancient tomb, or an intergalactic spy dashing through the hangar towards their getaway ship fueled for takeoff. A footrace across the room may be over in a matter of seconds, a car chase across the interstate may take hours, and chasing across countries might even take days. Whatever the scope of the chase, each participant in a chase has a position that is described by their distance from the goal in spaces. Acting in a Chase \uf0c1 There are a few special tests you might perform if you're part of a chase; you can perform a stunt to take a risk to get closer faster, you can create an obstacle to slow down other participants, and you can create a shortcut to speed up other participants. Performing a Stunt \uf0c1 If you want to perform a stunt to try to get to the goal faster, describe what you want to do to your gamemaster and together decide on how many actions it will take to attempt the stunt. Stunts are complicated, so you should have to spend at least two actions on them. Then, your gamemaster will have you make a test to see if you can pull it off. If you test an attribute to do something risky to get to the goal faster and you... Fail, the stunt goes wrong in some way. Move your speed towards the goal once. Partially succeed, you narrowly pull it off! For each action spent on the stunt, move your speed towards the goal. Then move your speed towards the goal once more for free. Fully succeeds, you pull off your stunt and catapult yourself forward. For each action spent on the stunt, move twice your speed towards the goal. Critically succeeds, your stunt is wildly successful. For each action spent on the stunt, move twice your speed towards the goal. Then move twice your speed towards the goal once more for free. Creating an Obstacle or Shortcut \uf0c1 If you create an obstacle or create a shortcut , you can change how many spaces away from the goal other participants are. Just like stunts, creating obstacles and shortcuts are complicated and require at least 2 actions to be spent on them. Like performing a stunt, figure out what you're risking and how many actions it will take to create the obstacle or shortcut. Then, also determine who the obstacle or shortcut will affect, based on what makes sense. Your gamemaster will then have you make a test to determine whether you create what you wanted. Creating an Obstacle \uf0c1 If you test an attribute to make it harder for somebody to get to the goal and you... Fail, you weren't able to make it more difficult to get to the goal. Partially succeed, you created the obstacle, but it wasn't as good as you imagined. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal to represent the obstacle's delay. Fully succeed, you created the obstacle in exactly the way you hoped you would. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal for each action spent on the obstacle. Critically succeed, you created a particularly hindering obstacle. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal for each action spent on the obstacle. Then they are moved a further five spaces away from the goal. Creating a Shortcut \uf0c1 If you test an attribute to make it easier for somebody to get to the goal and you... Fail, you weren't able to make it easier to get to the goal. Partially succeed, you made it easier to get to the goal, but it wasn't as good as you imagined. All affected participants are moved five spaces action towards the goal to represent the time saved by the shortcut. Fully succeed, everything played out in exactly the way you hoped you would. All affected participants are moved five spaces towards from the goal for each action spent on the shortcut. Critically succeed, your shortcut was particularly good at making it easier to get to the goal. All affected participants are moved five spaces towards the goal for each action spent on the obstacle. Then they are moved a further five spaces towards the goal. Shaking Pursuit \uf0c1 If you find yourself in a chase where you're attempting to shake your pursuers, your position is the goal of the chase. Any actions you take that would move you towards the goal instead move all of your pursuers that many spaces away. The chase ends when it makes sense to, usually after you've put a certain amount of spaces between yourself and your pursuers. Teams \uf0c1 Whenever it makes sense, you can team up with other characters to act like one participant in a chase. You can leave a team at any point in a round before your team takes a turn, or join a team at any point in a round before you've taken your turn. While in a team, all of you share a position and can only take actions or have initiative passed to you as a team.

When you have more than four hours of downtime available to you, ask your gamemaster how many downtime activities you can perform over the time you have. Crafting \uf0c1 You can spend your downtime to create or modify items by making progress (on something big) . Recipes for Crafting \uf0c1 If you make something more than once (or intend to make something more than once) brainstorm a recipe with your GM! A recipe is simply an agreed upon set of requirements that you need to create your item and a progress bar that shows when it'll be done. As long as it makes sense, filling a progress bar more than once usually means producing multiple of whatever it is that you're trying to create. Because of this, permanent items should have big progress bars that are difficult to fill in one sitting, while single use items should have small progress bars. Take this sleep poison, for instance: Sleep Poison Use a dose with an action to administer the poison in order to Hinder a target with a stack of Sleep; they fall into a deep slumber until all sleep dice are removed. Remove all sleep dice if they are awoken by someone else. If undisturbed, they may resist the poison every turn in an action scene, or every hour outside of an action scene. Recipe: Sleep Poison Requires your alchemists kit and a specific variety of mushrooms found in warm, damp caves. Progress Bar: 20/20 Downtime Activity Appendix \uf0c1 Other than crafting, the rest of these things have been mentioned somewhere else, but they're collected here for your convenience. Abandoning a Skill or Legacy \uf0c1 You can choose to regain some potential by abandoning a skill or legacy in addition to any other downtime activities. Creating or Leveling Up a Background \uf0c1 You can spend downtime reflecting on your past experiences to combine dice into backgrounds . Feel free to describe the scene as a flash back or a montage to the table to get everyone in on the fun. Developing Skills and Legacies \uf0c1 Downtime can be spent to develop your skills and legacies , whether it's training to further your swordsmanship , carousing to develop your reputation as a drinking buddy to everyone in town , or doing coursework to advance your skill in dragonology .

Because of this, permanent items should have big progress bars that are difficult to fill in one sitting, while single use items should have small progress bars. Take this sleep poison, for instance: Sleep Poison Use a dose with an action to administer the poison in order to Hinder a target with a stack of Sleep; they fall into a deep slumber until all sleep dice are removed. Remove all sleep dice if they are awoken by someone else. If undisturbed, they may resist the poison every turn in an action scene, or every hour outside of an action scene.

Flashback Stacks \uf0c1 Flashback stacks are a special stack built into the game that are created when you make preparations . In addition to using the dice on any roll that it makes sense some extra preparation beforehand could have benefited, flashback dice have the special ability to allow you to step back in time. When your GM describes a complication that your preparation could have resolved, you can spend one of your flashback dice to take the narrative back in time to describe how your preparation dealt with that problem. An adventuring party in Victorian London is investigating an elusive murderer. In an effort to capture them, the group takes a few days to take in the crime scene and prepare. Later, the group finds themselves deep in the sewers chasing after their quarry. In an effort to catch up to them, the mastermind of the group flashes back to purchasing a sewer map from a descendant of one of the original architects. The player marks off the cost of the map and uses it to corner the suspect and force a confrontation. Not every preparation is guaranteed to succeed, however. Your GM is well within their rights to ask you to test an attribute to see how well your preparation holds up, or even if things go well for you. If they do, you can use any number of flashback dice on the roll -- including any you haven't spent yet! An adventuring party plans to steal from a high security vault.

If a guard sounded the alarm, no amount of flashing back to bribing them will undo that the alarm has been pressed. However, if the GM describes the alarm being pressed but hasn't yet described the blaring alarm, it's totally valid for someone with tech savviness to cut in with a flashback to disabling the alarm system before the party made their way in. That said, don't be a jerk about this rule. The goal is to encourage a flow to the improvisational \"yes, and...\" of playing a roleplaying game, not to make every dramatic encounter a race to using a flashback die before the GM finishes describing a new threat.

Dice are either stacked in your favor , which means you can roll them to improve your rolls or defenses, or they are stacked against you , which means other people can use them to improve their rolls against you. Just like with skills and backgrounds , the name of the stack is how you determine if it makes sense that you can take some dice from it. How do you stack dice? \uf0c1 Whenever you try to create an advantage or disadvantage for yourself or someone else, you can test an attribute to stack dice for or against someone . You might duck behind cover to be 2d8 Protected by Barricade , read up on a monster you're hunting to gain 4d6 Knowledge of Cockatrice Weaknesses , or appeal to the room with a suave remark to get 3d10 Favor of the Crowd . You can also stack dice by using abilities or items that say they stack dice for or against people. What size of dice are stacked depends on the quality of the advantage or disadvantage created. Hiding behind a rotting fence might only give you d4s, while positioning yourself behind concrete might give you d12s. Ultimately, this is a gamemaster call so if you're thinking about stacking dice, feel free to ask them what size of dice you'd be stacking before you try to do it. Your GM will likely stack dice when it makes sense ; automatically stacking dice for somebody when they start an action scene with the upper hand, or against somebody when they wade into a sucking bog. How do you use stacks? \uf0c1 When you take dice off of a stack, you can either roll them to improve your roll for a test , or you can roll them to increase the difficulty of a test for somebody else. There's no limit to the number of dice that you can take from these stacks, as long as it makes sense that the stack would help you out on your test or make the other person's test more difficult. How long do stacks last? \uf0c1 When the last die is taken from a stack, the stack is gone. If you had dice stacked against you, you have either recovered from the disadvantageous situation or figured out how to deal with it. If you had dice stacked in your favor, your tactical advantage might be no longer applicable or might simply no longer provide the benefits it once did. Your GM may also clear stacks whenever they no longer make sense . Being pinned down by covering fire only makes sense for as long as there's somebody out there actively raining down bullets on you-- if they get taken out or have to focus their attention elsewhere, that stack should go away. Stacks also probably shouldn't last longer than a session, but if it makes sense it's ok if they do. How do I get rid of dice stacked against me? \uf0c1 Dice stacked against you can always be resisted. If you're 3d6 Tripped Up , you can test your Agility to regain your footing. If you're 1d12 Scared to Death you can test your Will to steel yourself. When you do whatever makes sense to resist the dice stacked against you, you can test an attribute to remove dice from a stack . Examples of stacks \uf0c1 2d6 Inspirational Bravery is stacked in favor of the inspired and can be used whenever they could benefit from steeling their will. 4d10 Seeing Shadows is stacked against the afflicted and could be used by anyone who wants to use a character's hallucinations against them. 3d12 Cover behind the Parapets is stacked in favor of anyone behind the stone fortifications and could be used to defend against arrows and other dangers. 6d4 Waist Deep in Sewage is stacked against the hapless wader, and could be used by monsters lurking under the water or a sniper taking advantage of the character's slowed movements.","title":"Dice Stacks"},{"location":"gameplay/stacks/#dice-stacks","text":"Dice stacks are a stack of dice of the same size with a name that describes them.

Dice Size \uf0c1 Simply Roleplaying uses dice of different sizes -- the more sides the die has, the \"bigger\" it's considered to be. From smallest to largest, they are; the four sided die (d4), the six sided die (d6), the eight sided die (d8), the ten sided die (d10), and the twelve sided die (d12). Simply Roleplaying also uses the twenty sided die (d20), but only for special abilities . Scenes and Distances \uf0c1 There are a couple of key words that Simply Roleplaying uses to define locations and distances. An area refers to the background of your immediate surroundings. If your senses could pick it up (birds chirping, insects buzzing, the smell of manure) it's in the same area as you. The scene describes the current drama or action. If you're a part of or can get to the action when it happens, you're in the same scene. When that drama or action ends, the scene does too. Ranges and Spaces \uf0c1 Things are either close , a short distance away, a medium distance away, a long distance away, or too far . Close things you can reach out and touch without moving. Things a short distance away can be reached with one action's worth of effort to get to them. Things a medium distance away with two action's worth of effort. Things a long distance away you have to spend three actions worth of effort to reach. Something too far can't be reached by you right now-- the best you can hope for is to get closer. When you want to use a grid or add precision to the size of something, you can use spaces instead to describe distances. Something close is 1 space away, something a short distance away is between 2 and 5 spaces away, something a medium distance away is between 6 and 10 spaces away, and something a long distance away is between 10 and 15 spaces away. Spaces are a relative measurement of the scene, so the actual distance that a space represents may vary depending on the scene. Narrative Truth \uf0c1 Sometimes the rules of Simply Roleplaying will say that something happens \"when it makes sense.\" This is a simple way of saying \"when the story we're telling together says it should happen.\" Certainly a character would heal from their wounds after some downtime recovering, but they might also recover health from a revitalizing spring. Generally what \"makes sense\" is obvious.

Note Gamemasters, if players are starting at a level higher than 1 their starting attributes should add up to twice their starting level -- they can distribute these attributes however they want as long as they adhere to the attribute level cap . What has your past taught you? \uf0c1 Think about where in the campaign world you come from, and why you are seeking out to adventure with your fellow players. Then, read up on skills, legacies, and backgrounds and choose to either make a background or start brimming with potential . If you chose to make a background , write a background that summarizes your character's story so far. If you chose to start brimming with potential , your gamemaster will allot you with a starting pool of 5 points of potential to spend on skills and legacies as you progress. Note Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish. If a player doesn't want to make all of the starting backgrounds, they can instead choose to take 5 points of potential per background they would have created. What things do you have with you? \uf0c1 Think about what possessions your character might have and write them down. This doesn't have to be an exhaustive list, but it should probably cover most things that you'd use to showcase what cool stuff your character can do. Consider writing down a sentimental object such as a an old, handwritten journal or a locket carrying an irreplaceable lock of grey hair. Even mundane objects, from bedrolls to mp3 players, can speak a lot about the character that carries them in their day-to-day and where they come from. Once you've finished figuring out what you've got, read up on items and add tags to anything that would benefit from having them. Be sure to talk to your gamemaster about the items and tags you've chosen. If your campaign is going to be combat focused, it's probably a good idea to have something with the Weapon tag. Example: Cavern Explorer A cavern explorer might have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, and a grappling hook (close-range). Example: Starship Diplomat A starship diplomat might have things like a universal translator, fine clothes, id card, hologram computer, a wax seal kit, and a handful of fountain pens. What power or talent makes you unique? \uf0c1 Your starting speed is 5 spaces . This is how many spaces you can move with an action . Your starting health is 24-- this is how much damage you can take before you sustain an injury. Read up on abilities and ability points, and consider what type of ability points make sense for your character. Then work with your GM to pick or create an ability for your character. Once you've done that, choose one: Give yourself another ability and add a point to your maximum ability points Pick something cool and unique to have as equipment-- something useful or mysterious that most people wouldn't have. Give it at least a +1 tag. Increase your health by 12. Create a helper or ally companion to assist your character What do you look like? \uf0c1 Describe your character! What's their heritage? Are they young or old? Thick or scrawny? What color skin? Eyes? Hair? What colors of clothing do they wear? How does their equipment look on them? Is it shiny and new? Dingy and poorly cared for? Ill fitting? Tailor-made? Be sure to pick a defining visual characteristic or two that highlights their history or personality. What is your name? \uf0c1 Now that you know everything about them, what kind of a name fits your character? Do they use their full name or a nickname? Do they know their family name? Are they proud of it?

Requirements, not Restrictions \uf0c1 Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them. If a player wants to make an ability called Godmode that makes them immortal. That should be on the table no matter how gamebreaking it appears. Protagonists with the ability to shape the world to their whim can create a compelling story. Just make sure you and/or your player check in with the rest of the table-- they may not want to play a TTRPG where somebody has cheat codes on. As long as you make sure that everyone is on the same page and having fun, that's what matters. If you're wondering if there's some kind of behind-the-scenes formula for making a balanced ability, the short answer is: there isn't. At least not up front. The longer answer is there isn't, but not for a lack of trying. After all, if you have an ability that turns all of your d12s into d20s when you attack an undead enemy, how useful that ability is depends entirely on how often the GM pits you against undead enemies. If you have an ability to fly, how useful that ability is depends on how often you need to and couldn't otherwise. Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities as you go . If an ability feels too strong? Give it an extra requirement, or make one of its requirements more costly! If an ability feels too weak? Give it an extra effect or strengthen one of its existing effects without requiring the character to upgrade it. Requirements \uf0c1 Rather than (or sometimes in addition to) costing abilty points, you can give abilities requirements that must be met for you to be able to use it. The more requirements an ability has, or the more costly the requirements, the more powerful the ability should be. Often, requirements will be things like: Wielding a specific tool, like being required to use weapons specific to your art to use a martial arts technique Being in a specific situation, like being required to be defending against a melee attack to perform a counter Taking a specific amount of time, like being required to spend some downtime to create a potion Fulfilling a specific narrative goal, like being required to memorize a character's mannerisms to disguise yourself as them Optional Requirements \uf0c1 You can make an ability more flexible by making it stronger if more requirements are met. These optional requirements are often things like spending extra ability points, taking additional time, or fulfilling an extra goal. For instance: Craft a Disguise If you've spent at least one period of downtime every day for the last seven days observing a character, you can disguise yourself as that character. You automatically pass as them visually and at a distance. If you've spent at least two periods of downtime each day observing them, you better understand their mannerisms. You automatically pass as them when interacting with all but their closest friends. Creating Multiple types of Ability Points \uf0c1 Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their mana to use abilities related to their magic power might also have flourishes that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both ammunition for their arsenal of weapons and psi points . An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions. You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you only gain that many ability points in total-- you must choose which of your types of ability points increase. Customizing Ability Points \uf0c1 If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it. If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities.","title":"Creating Abilities"},{"location":"running_the_game/creating_abilities/#creating-abilities","text":"This page is going to assume you've already read all about abilities -- if you haven't, I'd start there and then come back here and we can break down some more of the philosophy around creating them.","title":"Creating Abilities"},{"location":"running_the_game/creating_abilities/#requirements-not-restrictions","text":"Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them.

Picking the Difficulty \uf0c1 So how do you choose the specific number that your players roll against? First of all, you have to know what attribute you're testing, and what the player's level is in that attribute. Your players should have that on their character sheet, but if they don't you can just add their attribute modifier to their character level and that'll give you Check out the table below to see a rough mapping from an attribute's level to the difficulty of a test that will challenge it. Attribute level Test Difficulty 1 5 4 25 7 45 10 65 13 85 15 100 17 110 20 130 This is a good rule of thumb for your players power. However, you may notice that this table goes up to 20-- what the heck? Aren't players only supposed to go up to level 10, and their attributes up to +5? How could they possibly reach Level 20? The thing about this table is it's not going to be totally accurate to your party. It's a good rule of thumb, but as your players gather strong equipment and learn powerful abilities , they'll start rolling even higher than you might expect! Once they start doing so consistently, it's probably best to start keeping track of the level that your characters roll like in addition to the level they have on their character sheet, just so you know for planning purposes. Competitions \uf0c1 However, not all tests have a level-- it's also perfectly valid for a test to be a roll off between the involved characters. Take an arm wrestling contest with, for example -- it would be a test of brawn, and both players would roll against each other. The outcome of the test, then, comes from comparing the rolls rather than comparing the roll to a static number. In the rare event of a tie in a competition, everybody involved in the tie should either fail or partially succeed, depending on what makes sense to you. When you're dealing with three or more people involved in the same competition, it's probably best to abandon the idea of failing or succeeding entirely. Instead, judge how characters did by ranking them from highest to lowest roll. Offer Hard Choices when there are Multiple Risks \uf0c1 Lots of tests may have multiple risks involved. Chasing after a bad guy through a crowded alley in an unfamiliar city might have both the risk of letting them get away and getting lost in a part of town you don't know. While it's perfectly reasonable for a failure on a test to mean \"all of the bad stuff that could happen, does happen\" consider also offering hard choices to your players on which bad stuff might happen when they fail or partially succeed. Progress Bar \uf0c1 If your players are trying to do something and you just don't think they can do something like that in just one test, you can instead pick a target number and create a progress bar to track the effort spent. A progress bar starts at 0 and ends at whatever target number you set it at. Whenever your players roll on tests that contribute to the goal of the progress bar, add their roll to the progress meter to fill it up! Once the progress bar hits the number you targetted, the goal is accomplished! Optionally, you can also have additional \"stretch goals\" at further target numbers if your players want to keep going. Good Tests \uf0c1 A test is fundamentally useless without a goal , a risk , and an uncertainty . Without uncertainty, the narrative already clearly indicates what will happen, so it should just happen. Without a goal, the roller's agency is subverted-- if they don't know what they're trying to do, the number rolled doesn't mean anything to them. Without a risk, failure has no cost and the test is drained of tension. At best, it's boring-- at worst it's frustrating. This is not to say that tests need always be dramatic or life-changing-- changing the lettering of a sign to prank a party member is as valid a goal as crossing a precarious bridge. Getting caught by said party member in the middle of defacing a street sign is still a risk, it's just a less obvious one than tumbling off of that precarious bridge. The concept of goals and risks is something that relies on the players being immersed in their character, their surroundings, and the world at large. If you're playing with a bunch of people new to the system, take some time in an introductory dungeon to help your players think in terms of the goals they want to perform and the risks that might come with them. Goal Guidelines \uf0c1 Goals are a statement of intent and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. This is the part of tests that fall on the players to define. You should be prepared to ask questions until you are absolutely certain of the intention of the player's actions. If a player doesn't know what they are trying to do in the situation, consider presenting a few options like in a choose-your-own-adventure novel. Risk Guidelines \uf0c1 Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as taking a terrible injury, and should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Even something as apparently riskless as failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night, missing a crucial detail, or getting a fact wrong.","title":"Creating Tests"},{"location":"running_the_game/creating_tests/#creating-tests","text":"I'm assuming you've already read the players rules on tests -- if you haven't, I'd start there and then come back here and we can break down how to make them.","title":"Creating Tests"},{"location":"running_the_game/creating_tests/#picking-the-difficulty","text":"So how do you choose the specific number that your players roll against?
