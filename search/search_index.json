There were six players, ranging from people who had lots of experience with TTRPGs to people who had only ever heard of roleplaying. At the time I was running two weekly campaigns and I was eager to play-- there was just one problem. I didn't have any of the books for the system I had been running. All I had was a single set of polyhedral dice. So I winged it. I used the d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 as the way to distribute character strengths and weaknesses, decided on five categories (Agility, Brawn, Mental, Charisma, and Luck), and had each player distribute the five dice between them. For character creation, I gave them a quick writing prompt of \"You're in prison, about to be executed. What are you accused of?\" to chew on while we played and we got to the business of playing the game -- starting with a jailbreak. The one-shot turned into a campaign and it became clear that the system worked for my players, but it needed to develop to handle progression and other elements that the longer-length nature of a campaign promised. As players asked me for systems to do certain things, I improvised ways it could be done. Whatever worked, stuck. If you asked me, I'd say the system as it is now is still a work in progress -- it's been through many revisions and there are still elements of it that I'm not happy with. However, no matter how much my art-is-never-truly-finished brain really wants to protest it, it is ready to be run by people other than me. So, here it is. If I had to say one thing about the design of my system, it's that how simple that first session was to set up and go sticks with me. No matter how much I add to the system I will always endeavor to make sure that others can still recreate that magic with their players, should they wish to. About Me Hey! I'm Richard. When I was younger, I loved to tinker with the rules for any board game I played. Sometimes before I had even finished playing them through once! When I joined my parents' AD&D group, I started writing rule supplements for doing things that I thought would be cool, like overhauling the process for crafting and enchanting a weapon. I started putting pen to paper on my own games and systems in middle school. Any system I made was something that needed to be simple enough to be played on a whim at the lunch table or on a campout-- so that meant no dice or character sheets, let alone prep material. As a result, the systems I made were heavily narratively focused and had few mechanics beyond my players describing what they wanted to do and me improvising a world in response. In high school I built out a simple system with proper mechanics that was heavily inspired by Fire Emblem, and in college I started devouring other systems to learn from all the cool stuff that's out there! Outside of roleplaying games, I dig video games and I have a rather sizeable collection of board games of which I'm proud to say there are only a few that I've never played. I also \"spend a lot of time thinking about time\" as my roommate puts it-- there's something about having a good todo list and time tracker going that just really helps me keep everything in my life running smoothly.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-simply-roleplaying","text":"Simply Roleplaying started in 2013 at a friend's birthday party in college when somebody suggested I run a one-shot session.

A character in Simply Roleplaying is made up of several different pieces. If you're creating a character for the first time, you may want to check out the walkthrough in character creation . The content on this page and that page are almost the same, this one is just aimed at breaking everything on your character sheet down while that page is aimed at walking you through setting it up. Level Your level represents, generally, how strong you are. You add this to your attributes to determine the total number of dice you can roll from your skills, legacies, and backgrounds. Health and Injuries Health is how much damage you can take before you suffer an injury . Injuries take time to recover from, and if you take too many you'll be defeated . Injuries are both a box and a line describing the harm you took -- only the box matters for gameplay purposes, the text is just to remind you what happened so you know when it makes sense to recover from it. Attributes Attributes are broad categories which represent your strengths and weaknesses-- your physical strength, ability to quickly respond, willpower, and more. Any time you make a test of ability , it'll test a specific attribute and you'll add that attribute to your level to determine how many dice to roll. You also have passive attribute scores that you use instead of dice for when you respond reflexively to that attribute being tested. Skills, Legacies, and Backgrounds Skills, Legacies, and Backgrounds are the individual pieces that make up who you are and what you've learned. Skills describe what you know how to do: anything concrete that you can get better at, given practice. Legacies describe your reputation: your values, the factions you've allied with, and the deeds you've done. Backgrounds describe you: they're built from Skills and Legacies put together and summarized. Abilities and Ability Points Abilities are the unique and cool things your character can do. Casting magic, building inventions, or memorizing crucial details all can go here. Ability points are a pool of points that you can spend on doing cool ability stuff. Inventory Your inventory is filled with all the stuff you own. Anything you can use to accomplish a task is usually a piece of equipment and has tags that describe its properties. Items in your inventory are either equipped or not-- equipped items are usually visible and easy to get to, unequipped items are stored away somewhere on your person. Companions Your companions are anyone else who travels with you, but doesn't need a full character sheet to represent them. A helper offers you the support of their skills. An ally has attributes, damage, and inventory of their own, but shares your level, injuries, skills, legacies, backgrounds, and abilities.","title":"What Makes Up a Character?"},{"location":"character/#what-makes-up-a-character","text":"A character in Simply Roleplaying is made up of several different pieces.

Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the weapon tag, their power over gravity allows them to temporarily lift massive objects, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details! This section is written assuming that players and GMs will work together to create cool abilities, but you can also decide to create and curate a list of abilities that characters are able to choose from and that's a fine way to play too! That's the way most TTRPGs work, after all. What do Abilities do? Abilities do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway. Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them. If you want to make an ability called Godmode that makes you immortal. Go for it. Just make sure you check with your GM and the rest of the table-- they may not want to play a TTRPG where somebody has cheat codes on. Of course, that's not to say that characters shouldn't be overpowered! Protagonists with the ability to shape the world to their whim can create a compelling story. Just make sure that everyone is on the same page and having fun, that's what matters. Ok, but what do they usually do? Often, a character's abilities will do things like: Inflict damage Make a test to heal damage Create dice stacks ...which could be special stacks Give some equipment a specific tag Allow someone to do something as if they had equipment with a specific tag Move the character where they want to be Move someone else where the character wants them to be Do something narratively extraordinary (for instance, using powers ) If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a Test of Ability to resist the effects, setting the Difficulty and describing what happens if they Critically Succeed , Succeed , Partially Succeed , or Fail . Requirements Every ability has requirements that must be met for you to be able to use it. The more requirements an ability has, or the more costly the requirements, the more powerful the ability should be. Often, requirements will be things like: Wielding a specific tool, like being required to use weapons specific to your art to use a martial arts technique Being in a specific situation, like being required to be defending against a melee attack to perform a counter Taking a specific amount of time, like being required to spend some downtime to create a potion Fulfilling a specific narrative goal, like being required to memorize a character's mannerisms to disguise yourself as them Spending a specific resource, like being required to spend mana to cast a spell (usually, spending ability points) Optional Requirements You can make an ability more flexible by making it stronger if more requirements are met. These optional requirements are often things like spending extra ability points, taking additional time, or fulfilling an extra goal. For instance: Craft a Disguise If you've spent at least one period of downtime every day for the last seven days observing a character, you can disguise yourself as that character. You automatically pass as them visually and at a distance. If you've spent at least two periods of downtime each day observing them, you better understand their mannerisms. You automatically pass as them when interacting with all but their closest friends. Ability Points Consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do? An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of ability points . If you're not sure, it's okay to just call them \"ability points\" and come up with a name for them later-- but it is a good idea to come up with a name for them later. It helps to make the flavor of your character come to life! You start with a pool of 2 of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you spend some downtime to recover . You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their mana from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their ammunition in an arsenal. A leader might replenish their pride from cheering throngs of admirers. Creating Multiple types of Ability Points Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their mana to use abilities related to their magic power might also have flourishes that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both ammunition for their arsenal of weapons and psi points . An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions. You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you only gain that many ability points in total-- you must choose which of your types of ability points increase. Customizing Ability Points If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it. If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities. Gaining Ability Points and Creating Abilities Every 10 potential you earn (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two. Any number of times between sessions you can reduce your maximum ability points by 1 to learn a new ability , or reduce your maximum ability points by 2 to improve an existing ability . If you happen to have multiple pools of ability points you may reduce any one of them by 1 to learn a new ability, or 2 to improve an existing ability. You can also reduce two of them by 1 to improve an existing ability. Similarly, between sessions you can remove abilities from your character sheet if you feel like they don't belong-- whether you just don't like how they work or if you feel like they don't make sense to your character anymore. If you do, make sure you increase your maximum ability points to compensate for the points you spent to earn that ability. If you made up new abilities or improvements, it's a good idea to make sure you take some time to talk them over with your table and/or your GM before you introduce them. Upgrading Abilities As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either give them an extra effect or make them stronger . Giving an Ability an Additional Effect Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. If an ability gave you an extra d6 when gathering information about a monster, giving it an extra effect might allow you to create a 1d6 stack named I know [monster name] 's strengths and weaknesses as well. If an ability allowed you to give equipment the blessed and weapon tags, adding an extra effect might let you make a test of presence to heal the wielder too! Making an Ability Stronger If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. If an ability would push a target away from you, a stronger version of the ability might be able to push everyone within a close range of you away instead. If an ability would grant you an extra d4 when wielding weapons tagged with cleaving , a strengthened version of the ability might give you an extra d4 with cleaving or hooking -tagged weapons . Stronger abilities typically increase the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broaden the situations in which an ability might apply. Abilities Growing with Level When making an ability, you may not want all aspects of the ability to be improved by a player choosing to improve an ability -- increasing the difficulties for tests, the size of stacked dice, or the +X tag on ability-created equipment aren't things that necessarily feel rewarding to level up. Improving an ability should always feel like an improvement, it should never feel like keeping up. To that end, certain aspects of abilities should increase automatically as a character levels up. Dice stacked by an ability, for example, might start as d4s at level 1 and increase every two levels until level 8, when they become d12s. Test difficulties might increase by 10 every level. Here are some suggestions: Level Die Equipment Quality Test difficulty 1 1d4 +0 0 2 1d4 +1 10 3 1d6 +2 20 4 1d6 +3 30 5 1d8 +4 40 6 1d8 +5 50 7 1d10 +6 60 8 1d10 +7 70 9 1d12 +8 80 10+ 1d12 +9 90 You can also tie effects to things that are automatically improved every level like health, passive ability scores, and total dice. Let's Make Some Abilities All right, we've spent enough time talking about how they work. Let's make some ability points and an ability to use them. Tinkering Inventor What if our character was a Tinkering Inventor ? Someone who can always make the right tools for the job. Their abilities could be the inventions they create, powered by the scrap that the Inventor uses to make them. One ability could be Springloaded Boots -- a cobbled together contraption that allows the wearer to leap further and run faster... until it breaks. That's pretty easy to represent as stacks of dice that the Inventor puts together over some downtime. Ability points: Scrap Ability: Springloaded Boots Requirements Effect By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can... ...stack 4d4 Springloaded Boots in somebody's favor. And upgrading it would probably mean making the boots last longer and be more durable, so we can just increase the number of dice stacked. Requirements Effect By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can... ...stack 8d4 Springloaded Boots in somebody's favor. Alchemist What if our character was an Alchemist who produced poisons and potions? Their abilities could be the various potions effects they know how to make, powered by the concoctions that the Alchemist brews when the party rests. One ability could be a Health Potion that heals a bit of damage. Ability points: Concoctions Ability: Health Potion Requirements Effect By spending 1 concoction I can use an action to... ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach. We could then upgrade this potion to give it a secondary effect-- perhaps a stack of dice for being invigorated? Requirements Effect By spending 1 concoction I can use an action to... ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach and stack 2d4 Invigorated in their favor. Unassuming Assassin What if our character was an Unassuming Assassin ? Someone small or frail who nonetheless is a lethal threat. Their abilities could be powered by their ability to mentally note their enemy's weak spots with assassin's marks . One ability could be Strike Their Weaknesses -- a technique to make attacks with anything based on intuitive analysis rather than strength or speed. Ability points: Assassin's Marks Ability: Strike Their Weaknesses Requirements Effect By spending an assassin's mark when I'm hidden from my target I can... ...make attacks as though my weapons had the intuition tag until the end of my turn. Upgrading this ability might allow us to add another tag, maybe the concealable tag. Requirements Effect By spending an assassin's mark when I'm hidden from my target I can... ...make attacks as though my weapons had the intuition and concealable tags until the end of my turn. Internet Savant What if our character was an Internet Savant who mastered the art of utilizing the collective human knowledge present on the web? Their abilities could be powered by their cellular data . A core ability of theirs could be There's a Wiki for That , because of course there is. Ability points: Cellular Data Ability: There's a Wiki for That Requirements Effect By spending a point of cellular data when I spend some downtime to research information I can... ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. Upgrading this ability might allow the Savant to utilize some tidbits they picked up when researching as a stack of dice. Requirements Effect By spending a point of cellular data when I spend some downtime to research information I can... ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll and stack 4d4 in my favor named after what I researched. Street Brawler What if our character was a Street Brawler who was used to using anything at their disposal in a scrap? Their abilities could be powered by their reputation as a fighter. An ability of theirs could be Everything's a Weapon in My Hands , letting them improvise weapons from whatever they can grab. Ability points: Reputation Ability: Everything's a Weapon in My Hands Requirements Effect By spending a point of reputation when I'm using equipment without the weapon tag... ...I can give it the weapon tag for the scene. (The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one) Upgrading this ability could make those weapons more lethal by giving them an extra tag. Requirements Effect By spending a point of reputation when I'm using equipment without the weapon tag... ...I can give it the weapon tag for the scene. It also gets the +1 tag if it isn't already tagged with a bigger +X tag. (The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one) Improving an Ability Throughout a Campaign Here's a more in-detail example of how one could make an ability stronger over the course of multiple enhancements. Let's start with the ability Berserking Berserking Requirements Effect By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. A good starting point, but let's see if we can make it more interesting. The next chance we get to improve abilities, we choose to make the ability stronger . We can't increase the number of dice that we have, but we can change the dice into a stack that can be used more than once. Since stacks are more broadly useful than just attacks, let's also change the trigger to an action. Berserking II Requirements Effect By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... ...stack 2d4 Berserking in my favor for the scene. Already this is looking jucier. Now, not only do we get a 1d4 bonus to attacks, but we can also spend the dice from the stack for breaking down doors, resisting mind control, and all kinds of other stuff that having a Berserking stack might help with. Where do we go from here? Well, a simple route would just be to increase the number of dice that we have on the Berserking stack to get more Berserking Time, but what if we made it a special stack? We'd need our gamemaster's approval and their help making some balanced tweaks, but with their help we could come up with something like... Berserking III Requirements Effect By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... ...stack 1d4 Berserking in my favor for the scene with the following rules: Berserking When you make an attack , stack another die. The first time you take damage each turn, stack another die. If you end your turn without removing a die from the stack, they are all lost. This is what our gamemaster helped us come up with. They're a special stack that feeds themselves the more that we attack and take damage, but have the downside of needing to be used at least once on each of our turns or they go away. Now we're really getting somewhere! But... what if we could make it even better? Our gamemaster has an idea for that-- they say that if we want to, we can upgrade the ability again to remove the restriction that causes us to lose the stack. Berserking IV Requirements Effect By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... ...stack 1d4 Berserking in my favor for the scene with the following rules: Berserking When you make an attack , stack another die. The first time you take damage each turn, stack another die. Wow. We are now three improvements deep into this ability and it feels pretty powerful indeed. By spending just one of our resources, we get powerful these dice that we can feed off of making attacks and taking damage, like a true berserker might. If we play our cards right, we'll be adding dice front, left, and center all battle long! Keeping it All \"Balanced\" Gamemasters, as you've been reading through this section you're probably wondering if there's some kind of behind-the-scenes mechanic for making a balanced ability. The short answer is: there isn't. The longer answer is there isn't, but not for a lack of trying. I spent quite some time working out various systems for point-buying your way to \"balanced\" abilities, but at the end of the day they all ended up being unbalanced in one way or another. After all, if you have an ability that gives you an extra d8 when you attack an undead enemy, how useful that ability is depends entirely on how often the GM pits you against undead enemies. If you have an ability to fly, how useful that ability is depends on how often you need to and couldn't otherwise. Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities as you go . If an ability feels too strong? Give it an extra requirement, or make one of its requirements more costly! If an ability feels too weak? Give it an extra effect or strengthen one of its existing effects without requiring the character to upgrade it.","title":"Abilities"},{"location":"character/abilities/#abilities","text":"Abilities are the cool mechanics that show off what makes your character awesome.

Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities as you go . If an ability feels too strong?

Skills are things you've trained yourself to be good at, legacies are accomplishments and behaviors you're known for, and backgrounds summarize your character by combining several skills and/or legacies together. Improving Skills and Legacies Every skill and legacy starts out at d4 and can grow to be as powerful as d12. Whenever you spend some downtime doing something that improves the skill or legacy, you can spend potential to acquire a skill or legacy you did not have, writing it down as a d4 skill or legacy, respectively, or to level up an existing skill or legacy to the next largest die size. Developing Skills Whenever you spend downtime to take some time to train or gain a flash of insight , you can spend potential to either learn a new skill that you do not have written down on your character sheet or to level up a skill that you do have written down. How a character takes some time to train varies from individual to individual, but usually involves several hours of downtime , a trainer, and/or suitable materials to study from. A character can act as a trainer for a skill provided that it pertains to one of their backgrounds. This means that a character can train themselves in a skill once they've incorporated it into a background! A character gains a flash of insight in the moment. You can declare you gain insight right before making a test of ability, right after, or even by watching someone else do something awesome. Whenever it makes sense, a player may declare that their character has gained insight in either a skill that was used or in a skill that could have been used in the situation. Earning Legacies Whenever you do something memorable or act like your reputation , you can spend potential to either start a new legacy that isn't written on your character sheet, or level up a legacy that you already have written down. Doing something memorable sounds broad, and that's because it is! Doing something memorable might be joining a faction, making an enemy, or saving a town. Any time you do anything that underscores your character's values in a way that other characters can talk about it, that's something memorable. Acting like your reputation is exactly what it sounds like. Whenever you do anything that your character is known to do, even if you haven't written it down on your character sheet yet, that's acting like your reputation. Renaming a Skill or Legacy Leveling up a skill or legacy can also be an opportunity to refine it. Whenever you level up a skill or legacy you can also rename it to better represent the skill or legacy that your character is developing. A character with the skill Spotting Traps narrowly avoids the last arrow trap of a dungeon and gains insight , spending a point of potential to level up the skill. As they reflect on how it might be less useful back above ground, they decide to rename the skill to Quick Reflexes as they level it up. A character with the legacy Wanted Pickpocket acts like their reputation and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy by formally accepting membership to the Blackgrass Thieves' Guild. Not wanting to limit themselves to picking pockets, they change the name of the legacy to Blackgrass Thieves' Guild Member . A character with the skill Research spends days trying to crack the secrets of an alien artifact, working with a librarian to help train them in getting better at researching. To represent both the newfound knowledge and to help them get more specific answers in the future, they decide to rename the skill to Extraterrestrial Research as they level it up. A character with the legacy Monster Hunter does something memorable by landing the killing blow on the dragon who has been terrorizing the countryside and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy. Since slaying a dragon is surely more impressive than the other creatures they've defeated, they decide they'd rather the legacy be named Dragonslayer . Abandoning a Skill or Legacy Sometimes a skill or legacy might not work out for your character. Maybe it was too specific, just isn't very useful in the long term, or your character has had a shift in priorities such that what you wrote down no longer makes sense for them. In that case, you can always choose to forget . During any period of downtime or whenever else it makes sense you may decrease the die level of one of your skills or legacies to reclaim one point of potential. This can represent the public's waning attention to your deeds in the case of a legacy, or your character losing interest in or forgetting about that skill in preparation to learn something new. Building a Background If you have at least two related d12 skills and/or legacies during downtime or any other time that makes sense you can combine them together to form a background . Similarly, if you have at least one d12 skill or legacy related to one of your existing backgrounds you can add it to that existing background. To create a background, write down a phrase that summarizes the skills and/or legacies as they relate to your character followed by the number of d12s you put into the background. Then erase the old legacies and skills -- they're part of the background now! The next time you make a new legacy or skill, you can reuse the name of one of the skills or legacies you just erased to represent additional reputations and capabilities beyond what the background describes. A character has a d12 Acrobatics skill and a d12 Robs from the rich to feed the poor legacy, they can combine them together into a 2d12 background called Robin Hood of Crookshack Row . The same character develops a d12 Thief of Luiena's Crown legacy. Since this is relevant to their 2d12 Robin Hood of Crookshack Row background, they can add a d12 to that background and rename it, turning it into the 3d12 Crownthief of Staedbergh background. Renaming a Background Whenever it makes sense for the name of a background to change, you can rename it to something else. A Bloodthirsty Warlord might become a Repentant General , an Assassin for Hire might become a Silencer of the Court , or a Master Blacksmith might become the Silversmith of Ardent . Sometimes the change is less story driven and more that you've come up with a better name to describe that grouping of skills. That's fine too! Backgrounds should be renamed until you're happy with how they express your character. Naming Guidelines Don't worry too much about coming up with the perfect name, it's often enough to create a good name. Skills and legacies are just the building blocks of backgrounds and backgrounds should be renamed until they feel right. That said, the trickiest part about creating skills, legacies, and backgrounds is coming up with a good name for them. Ideally the naems should be expressive of what you want your character to be able to do while still remaining general enough that they can come up a lot in play. Naming a Skill Skill names should focus on a specific capability that can be learned or taught with names like Biology , Swordfighting , and Archeology . They sometimes almost sound like the names of academic courses! If you're struggling to think of a good way to name a skill, just try filling in a blank in the sentence \"I'm good at _______.\" with a phrase that describes the skill. Whatever you fill the blank in with is likely a great name for the skill! Since the way you level up your skills is by taking some time to train or gaining a flash of inspiration , be sure to think of how you'll train those skills and scenes that show how your character was able to innovate on their own based on something they saw or did. Archery can only be leveled up when you pick up a bow and arrow, but Marksmanship could be leveled from excelling at a game of darts! Naming a Legacy Legacy names should focus on your character's reputation and things they've done, but should also represent the developing nature of the legacy. Legacies can be a phrase describing your displayed values, a title awarded, or anything else that showcases your budding reputation. Legacies are also a great space for representing ranks in factions-- joining any faction and advancing in rank are both definitely doing something memorable, and acting in line for that faction will always be acting like your reputation. Since the way that you level up your legacies is by doing something memorable and acting like your reputation , make sure to think about how you'll level up your legacy as you write it down! Robbed a noble can likely only be leveled up whenever you rob someone or talk about how you did, but Steals from the rich to feed the poor can be leveled up both by being a thief and whenever you perform an act of charity! Naming a Background A good rule of thumb is to name your background something that you might use in a sentence to describe your character. Backgrounds could be jobs like Blacksmith , Hacker , or Guerilla Sniper , roles like Healer , Tactician , or Tank , or even quick descriptions like Outcast of Newport City , Penny Pinching Accountant , or Iron Willed Gunslinger . Really, there's not much of a definition for what a background can or can't be; if it sums up both an aspect of your character and the skills and legacies you put into it's probably a good background! Additional Examples Here are some additional examples of skills based on a attribute they work well with, and some background examples of how they might be combined. While skills are never limited by what attribute you use them with, sometimes thinking about what attribute you want to improve will help you decide on what kind of skill to learn. Skills to augment Agility tests primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are Acrobatics , Rubix Cube Solving , and Sneaking . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Criminal Mastermind . Skills to augment Brawn tests primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples are Breaching Doors , Lifting , and Swimming . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Military Commando . Skills to augment Intuition tests primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples are Driving , Gambling , and Streetwise . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Getaway Driver . Skills to augment Knowledge tests primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples are Bandit Culture , Political History , and Sewing . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Gang Savvy Granny . Skills to augment Presence tests primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples are Animal Handling , Bluff , and Political Appeal . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Druid Politician . Skills to augment Will tests primarily focus on a character's ability to shut out distractions or act despite hardship. Some examples are Acting under Pressure , Ignoring Pain , and Spirit .

You can declare you gain insight right before making a test of ability, right after, or even by watching someone else do something awesome. Whenever it makes sense, a player may declare that their character has gained insight in either a skill that was used or in a skill that could have been used in the situation.","title":"Developing Skills"},{"location":"character/backgrounds/#earning-legacies","text":"Whenever you do something memorable or act like your reputation , you can spend potential to either start a new legacy that isn't written on your character sheet, or level up a legacy that you already have written down. Doing something memorable sounds broad, and that's because it is! Doing something memorable might be joining a faction, making an enemy, or saving a town. Any time you do anything that underscores your character's values in a way that other characters can talk about it, that's something memorable. Acting like your reputation is exactly what it sounds like. Whenever you do anything that your character is known to do, even if you haven't written it down on your character sheet yet, that's acting like your reputation.","title":"Earning Legacies"},{"location":"character/backgrounds/#renaming-a-skill-or-legacy","text":"Leveling up a skill or legacy can also be an opportunity to refine it. Whenever you level up a skill or legacy you can also rename it to better represent the skill or legacy that your character is developing. A character with the skill Spotting Traps narrowly avoids the last arrow trap of a dungeon and gains insight , spending a point of potential to level up the skill. As they reflect on how it might be less useful back above ground, they decide to rename the skill to Quick Reflexes as they level it up. A character with the legacy Wanted Pickpocket acts like their reputation and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy by formally accepting membership to the Blackgrass Thieves' Guild. Not wanting to limit themselves to picking pockets, they change the name of the legacy to Blackgrass Thieves' Guild Member . A character with the skill Research spends days trying to crack the secrets of an alien artifact, working with a librarian to help train them in getting better at researching. To represent both the newfound knowledge and to help them get more specific answers in the future, they decide to rename the skill to Extraterrestrial Research as they level it up. A character with the legacy Monster Hunter does something memorable by landing the killing blow on the dragon who has been terrorizing the countryside and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy. Since slaying a dragon is surely more impressive than the other creatures they've defeated, they decide they'd rather the legacy be named Dragonslayer .","title":"Renaming a Skill or Legacy"},{"location":"character/backgrounds/#abandoning-a-skill-or-legacy","text":"Sometimes a skill or legacy might not work out for your character. Maybe it was too specific, just isn't very useful in the long term, or your character has had a shift in priorities such that what you wrote down no longer makes sense for them. In that case, you can always choose to forget . During any period of downtime or whenever else it makes sense you may decrease the die level of one of your skills or legacies to reclaim one point of potential. This can represent the public's waning attention to your deeds in the case of a legacy, or your character losing interest in or forgetting about that skill in preparation to learn something new.","title":"Abandoning a Skill or Legacy"},{"location":"character/backgrounds/#building-a-background","text":"If you have at least two related d12 skills and/or legacies during downtime or any other time that makes sense you can combine them together to form a background . Similarly, if you have at least one d12 skill or legacy related to one of your existing backgrounds you can add it to that existing background. To create a background, write down a phrase that summarizes the skills and/or legacies as they relate to your character followed by the number of d12s you put into the background. Then erase the old legacies and skills -- they're part of the background now! The next time you make a new legacy or skill, you can reuse the name of one of the skills or legacies you just erased to represent additional reputations and capabilities beyond what the background describes. A character has a d12 Acrobatics skill and a d12 Robs from the rich to feed the poor legacy, they can combine them together into a 2d12 background called Robin Hood of Crookshack Row . The same character develops a d12 Thief of Luiena's Crown legacy. Since this is relevant to their 2d12 Robin Hood of Crookshack Row background, they can add a d12 to that background and rename it, turning it into the 3d12 Crownthief of Staedbergh background.","title":"Building a Background"},{"location":"character/backgrounds/#renaming-a-background","text":"Whenever it makes sense for the name of a background to change, you can rename it to something else. A Bloodthirsty Warlord might become a Repentant General , an Assassin for Hire might become a Silencer of the Court , or a Master Blacksmith might become the Silversmith of Ardent .

Skills and legacies are just the building blocks of backgrounds and backgrounds should be renamed until they feel right. That said, the trickiest part about creating skills, legacies, and backgrounds is coming up with a good name for them. Ideally the naems should be expressive of what you want your character to be able to do while still remaining general enough that they can come up a lot in play.","title":"Naming Guidelines"},{"location":"character/backgrounds/#naming-a-skill","text":"Skill names should focus on a specific capability that can be learned or taught with names like Biology , Swordfighting , and Archeology . They sometimes almost sound like the names of academic courses! If you're struggling to think of a good way to name a skill, just try filling in a blank in the sentence \"I'm good at _______.\" with a phrase that describes the skill. Whatever you fill the blank in with is likely a great name for the skill! Since the way you level up your skills is by taking some time to train or gaining a flash of inspiration , be sure to think of how you'll train those skills and scenes that show how your character was able to innovate on their own based on something they saw or did. Archery can only be leveled up when you pick up a bow and arrow, but Marksmanship could be leveled from excelling at a game of darts!","title":"Naming a Skill"},{"location":"character/backgrounds/#naming-a-legacy","text":"Legacy names should focus on your character's reputation and things they've done, but should also represent the developing nature of the legacy. Legacies can be a phrase describing your displayed values, a title awarded, or anything else that showcases your budding reputation. Legacies are also a great space for representing ranks in factions-- joining any faction and advancing in rank are both definitely doing something memorable, and acting in line for that faction will always be acting like your reputation. Since the way that you level up your legacies is by doing something memorable and acting like your reputation , make sure to think about how you'll level up your legacy as you write it down!

Skills to augment Agility tests primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are Acrobatics , Rubix Cube Solving , and Sneaking .

Equipped items are things you're wearing, holding, have on your belt-- anything that you know exactly where it is and can grab it immediately in a pinch. Just like what's in your inventory, what you have equipped should make sense . Whenever you have the opportunity, often with downtime but it can be as flexible as your GM would like, you can equip and unequip items. When you're in an action scene you can use anything you have equipped without taking any time to pull it out or put it away.

Action scenes are exactly what they sound like -- fast paced moments that you might see in an action movie or video game. While in movies or video games, action scenes are often fast paced and happen in real time, Action scenes are turn based to allow players their space to contribute to the narrative. There are some things that are broadly applicable to all kinds of action scenes, but sometimes you may want to slightly tweak those rules to better convey the feeling of different types of scenes -- a battle will feel differently from a chase, for instance. Who Goes When Since they're usually taking place in a short duration of time, everyone and everything that impacts the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking turns over the course of one 10 second round . Of course, it's possible that the length of a round may vary depending on what kind of action scene you're in -- a race around the world, for instance, might instead have rounds that take place over days or even weeks. Taking Turns The following is adapted from the ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post Accidentally Designing Marvel\u2019s Action Order System which has since been removed -- linked is a reprint of the post in the FATE SRD. The first round of the action scene, figure out who made the first move. Almost every chase starts with someone bolting and almost every battle starts with someone firing the first shot. Whatever that action was, play it out and let them take the rest of their turn if they still have more to do. Then, after the first person to go has finished their turn, they must choose another character or obstacle in the scene who has not taken a turn yet this round to take the next turn. This includes characters who so far haven't contributed to the action scene, introducing them to the fray. If there's nobody left who hasn't taken a turn yet this round, congratulations! You're the last person in the round and you get the strategic advantage of being able to pick anybody in the scene to start the next one. Interrupting Turns If you have an ability that lets you do it you can interrupt the turn order, taking your turn in place of whomever was originally being passed to. If you do, at the end of your turn you may choose whomever you want to take their turn next -- you don't have to pass the turn order on to the person who was originally going to take their turn. Who do I pass to? At the end of your turn, you're going to be faced with a choice -- who do you want to pass to? Sometimes the answer to this is just \"who does it make sense to pass to\"? If you're having a tense 1-on-1 duel with an enemy, you might want to make your move and then pass to them to keep the back-and-forth going. Sometimes the answer is teamwork! Maybe you set up a teammate for success by creating stacks for them, or they let you know they have a great follow up for whatever you're doing. Passing to an enemy seems bad on its face, but actually has some strong tactical value. By passing to an enemy, you get to see what they'll do during the round and be more able to react to it. In addition, sometimes passing to an enemy can secure your team ending the round. Used cleverly, this can allow some key characters the opportunity to take two turns in a row-- one at the end of the round, and one at the start of the next round. GM Tips: Dealing with Action Economy with Bosses and Squads As a GM, you might want to swarm the players with lots of low level mooks or pit them against one big bad boss. Since we're passing initiative around it's easy for the side with more characters to hang on to who starts the next round, which isn't always what you want! If the boss is outnumbered and you want to make them stronger, give the boss a few more turns. If that feels too strong, limit what the boss can do on each turn-- maybe they only get 2 actions per turn, or on their first turn they get their full 3 actions, but every other turn the boss has only 1 action. You can even do some cool cinematic stuff here by giving the boss an attack that hits many spaces that they spend an action on to wind up on their first turn, then spend an action to complete on one of their subsequent turns. If the players are outnumbered by low-level mooks but you don't want the strength in numbers to feel too overwhelming, try marking a group of them as a squad! Squads are simply a set of characters that will always pass their action to another character in their \"squad\" until none are available. This helps your players (and you!) so the turn can be passed to \"the bandits\" instead of needing to specify which specific bandit they're referring to. Actions When it's your turn, you can take up to 3 actions . One action on its own measures something quick like making an attack, hiding behind a pillar, or triggering a mechanism. Multiple actions can be used, even across turns or rounds, to do time consuming or difficult things like pushing over a statue, disarming the security measures on a door, or reloading a siege weapon. If it makes sense characters can contribute their actions towards an effort in progress by another character. This would allow a group of three to push over a statue that requires 9 actions to topple in the span of a single round. If you're spending lots of actions to do a task you usually you can't just stop in the middle and then pick it up later. However, if somebody else lends a helping hand to your effort it usually makes sense that you can do something else and leave the rest to them. Moving Your Speed Every character (and some objects) have a speed , measured in spaces. When a character uses their action to move, they can move a distance up to their speed. This movement might be sprinting, running and leaping, swimming, riding a horse, or driving a car. Your GM may say that some spaces take up extra spaces of movement if the terrain is difficult to traverse or if there's some other reason you might need to slow down when moving through it. Defining Scene-Specific Actions: Chases Sometimes it can be helpful to define specific actions that can be taken in an action scene. Chases, for instance, are a special kind of action scene that capture the fast back-and-forth between participants as they race towards the goal. Because distance towards the goal is the primary focus, there are several special actions that deal primarily with that detailed here . Freeform Action Scene The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when observing strict rules for an action scene would get in the way of the drama of the scene. A freeform action scene is any action scene that uses some, but not all, rules that are normally a part of an action scene. There may or may not be any defined actions or even an established turn order. This allows each character the freedom to act as would make sense to the scene.","title":"Action Scenes"},{"location":"gameplay/action/#action-scenes","text":"When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, it really matters when you can do what.

While your gamemaster can absolutely decide on how much potential to award on their own (one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is about right), roleplaying is constructing a shared narrative and unplanned progress through a character arc is just as important as advancing the plot. Checklists and Goals A way everybody can help determine how many points of potential to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with \"Gain a point of potential if we...\"-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential. Session goals can be as specific as \"Gain a point of potential if we defeat the Bronzeridge Bandits,\" or as generic as \"Gain a point of potential if everyone had fun.\" You don't have to come up with the perfect session goals the first time around-- session goals can always be changed after each session, and should always be changed if the group isn't feeling them. The goal of session goals is to encourage players to do the things that the group enjoys. The more fun the session, the more potential everybody should get! Here are some end-of-session goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session. At the end of a session: Gain a point of potential if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by Gain a point of potential if we accomplished something new and important Gain a point of potential if we learned something important about the world, or if something important changed Gain a point of potential if we learned something important about a player character, or if something important changed Personal Goals Session goals don't have to be shared-- if your group is comfortable with players having differing amounts of potential, you can play with the idea of having personal goals in addition to the group checklist. You should reduce the number of shared goals if characters have their own personal goals, since you probably want to keep a one-to-one ratio between hours played and goals possible to achieve. Personal goals are set by each player on their own based on whatever makes sense for their character. They can be changed after each session, or whenever the player and gamemaster agree that they should be changed. Personal goals often end up being more specific than shared goals-- especially when you're still feeling out your character --but they should evolve overtime into something generic that reliably cuts to the core of your character. Early goals like these: Gain a point of potential if you protected Wren from the brigands Gain a point of potential if you take a thieves guild job Gain a point of potential if you talk your way into the art show Can become these: Gain a point of potential if you put yourself in harms way to protect another Gain a point of potential if you skimmed a little off the top for yourself Gain a point of potential if you convinced someone to see it your way Potential Potential is a measure of your growth. You'll start with some potential during character creation , and then earn more at the end of every session. You can then spend that potential in game, after the game, and/or out of game -- depending on what your group prefers -- to improve, skills and legacies , increase your character's health and specific ability points , and/or to gain new abilities . Spending Potential You can spend one point of potential to: * Learn or level up a skill or legacy * Increase your character's health per injury by 1 You can spend two points of potential to: * Increase one of your pools of ability points by 1 * Create a new pool of ability points You can spend three points of potential to: * Learn a new ability * Strengthen an existing ability Leveling Up Leveling up means more dice to use on tests! Usually, you'll level up at the end of significant story arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. Expect to level up about every 25 points of potential earned. If you're starting to feel like you're investing in skills and backgrounds that aren't very important to your character because you can't level up the skills and backgrounds that are core to your character anymore, make sure to let your gamemaster know! That's usually a sign that you need a level up. Increase Your Attributes When you level up, pick two attributes and increase their level by 1. Just make sure you're not going past the attribute level cap . Character Check-In In addition to the power bump of being able to roll more dice, leveling up also provides a space for you and your gamemaster to check-in and rework any aspects of the character that just aren't working.

Think of a necromancer fleeing as the tide turns against his undead minions, an archeologist braving the ocean to be first to reach an ancient tomb, or an intergalactic spy dashing through the hangar towards their getaway ship fueled for takeoff. A footrace across the room may be over in a matter of seconds, a car chase across the interstate may take hours, and chasing across countries might even take days. Whatever the scope of the chase, each participant in a chase has a position that is described by their distance from the goal in spaces. Acting in a Chase There are a few special tests you might perform if you're part of a chase; you can perform a stunt to take a risk to get closer faster, you can create an obstacle to slow down other participants, and you can create a shortcut to speed up other participants. Performing a Stunt If you want to perform a stunt to try to get to the goal faster, describe what you want to do to your gamemaster and together decide on how many actions it will take to attempt the stunt. Stunts are complicated, so you should have to spend at least two actions on them. Then, your gamemaster will have you make a test of ability to see if you can pull it off. If you make a test with the intention of doing something risky to get to the goal faster and you... Fail, the stunt goes wrong in some way. Move your speed towards the goal once. Partially succeed, you narrowly pull it off! For each action spent on the stunt, move your speed towards the goal. Then move your speed towards the goal once more for free. Fully succeeds, you pull off your stunt and catapult yourself forward. For each action spent on the stunt, move twice your speed towards the goal. Critically succeeds, your stunt is wildly successful. For each action spent on the stunt, move twice your speed towards the goal. Then move twice your speed towards the goal once more for free. Creating an Obstacle or Shortcut If you create an obstacle or create a shortcut , you can change how many spaces away from the goal other participants are. Just like stunts, creating obstacles and shortcuts are complicated and require at least 2 actions to be spent on them. Like performing a stunt, figure out what you're risking and how many actions it will take to create the obstacle or shortcut. Then, also determine who the obstacle or shortcut will affect, based on what makes sense. Your gamemaster will then have you make a test of ability to determine whether you create what you wanted. Creating an Obstacle If you make a test with the intent of making it harder for somebody to get to the goal and you... Fail, you weren't able to make it more difficult to get to the goal. Partially succeed, you created the obstacle, but it wasn't as good as you imagined. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal to represent the obstacle's delay. Fully succeed, you created the obstacle in exactly the way you hoped you would. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal for each action spent on the obstacle. Critically succeed, you created a particularly hindering obstacle. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal for each action spent on the obstacle. Then they are moved a further five spaces away from the goal. Creating a Shortcut If you make a test with the intent of making it easier for somebody to get to the goal and you... Fail, you weren't able to make it easier to get to the goal. Partially succeed, you made it easier to get to the goal, but it wasn't as good as you imagined. All affected participants are moved five spaces action towards the goal to represent the time saved by the shortcut. Fully succeed, everything played out in exactly the way you hoped you would. All affected participants are moved five spaces towards from the goal for each action spent on the shortcut. Critically succeed, your shortcut was particularly good at making it easier to get to the goal. All affected participants are moved five spaces towards the goal for each action spent on the obstacle. Then they are moved a further five spaces towards the goal. Shaking Pursuit If you find yourself in a chase where you're attempting to shake your pursuers, your position is the goal of the chase. Any actions you take that would move you towards the goal instead move all of your pursuers that many spaces away. The chase ends when it makes sense to, usually after you've put a certain amount of spaces between yourself and your pursuers. Teams Whenever it makes sense, you can team up with other characters to act like one participant in a chase. You can leave a team at any point in a round before your team takes a turn, or join a team at any point in a round before you've taken your turn. While in a team, all of you share a position and can only take actions or have initiative passed to you as a team.

Of course, there may be extra risks or slightly different goals depending on the situation, but these should cover your bases! Consider these as \"here's what I can do\" in any given situation. Attacking with a weapon Attacking with a weapon is a test of one of the attributes that the weapon is tagged with against a difficulty of the armor value of a target within the range tagged on the weapon. When you make a test of any attribute with a goal to attack with a weapon , if they... Fail: Their target takes no damage. Partially succeed: Their target takes damage equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down. Fully succeed: Their target takes damage equal the attacker's total for the test. Critically Succeed: Their target takes damage equal to double the attacker's total for the test. Improvised weapons If you attack with an object not intended to be a weapon or with a weapon in a way that it's not intended to be used, your GM may say there is an additional risk of the weapon might be damaged, destroyed, or otherwise lost . In addition, your GM may say some tags on the weapon do not apply , depending on what makes sense. A high quality rifle isn't necessarily a good bludgeon. Stacking dice for or against someone When you make a test of any attribute to stack dice for or against someone , if you... Fail: Stack two dice against yourself, or remove two dice from the existing stack Partially succeed: Stack two dice on the new or existing stack Fully succeed: Stack three dice on the new or existing stack Critically Succeed: Stack four dice on the new or existing stack Unstacking dice When you make a test of any attribute to remove dice from a stack , if you... Fail: Stack two dice instead Partially succeed: Take two dice off of the stack Fully succeed: Take three dice off of the stack Critically Succeed: Take four dice off of the stack Finding answers to questions If you're trying to answers to questions , whether it's by researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual, make a test of the appropriate attribute and then ask the GM some questions. When you make a test of any attribute to find answers to questions , if you... Fail: You may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely Partially succeed: You may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully Succeed: You may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully Critically Succeed: You may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully If you're not sure what to ask, \"What questions should I ask?\" is always a good question. It counts towards the number of questions you get, but hones in on the juicy stuff your GM might have for you to discover. It's also realistic-- it's not often that a character knows what question they're trying to answer right when they start looking for information. The answers to the questions should both make sense and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question \"Who killed this person?\" with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with \"someone with red hair and a blue cloak\" based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby. Questions cannot be wasted. If the answer to a question was already stated, it doesn't count. If the answer to a question would not normally require a test to uncover, it doesn't count. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, it doesn't count and the person asked the question should explain why it is not answerable and how to make it answerable, if possible. Progressing a complicated goal If you're trying to do something and you can't do it in just one test, your GM may say that the goal of your test is to fill a progress meter ! When you make a test of any attribute to fill a progress meter , if you... Fail: You instead make things more complicated, either by falling victim to an existing risk or introducing a new one Partially succeed: Fill the progress meter by half of what you rolled Fully succeed: Fill the progress meter by what you rolled Critically Succeed: Fill the progress meter by twice what you rolled Making preparations While it can be rewarding to act out the players gathering information before going on a heist or gearing up before setting out on adventure, sometimes it's more fun to roll for preparation and cut to the chase. When a character takes some downtime and makes a test of any attribute with a goal to prepare for a situation , if they... Fail: They get two flashbacks, but one of them is guaranteed to go wrong. Partially succeed: They get two flashbacks. Fully succeed: They get three flashbacks. Critically Succeed: They get four flashbacks What are flashbacks? When the GM describes a complication that your preparation could have resolved, you can spend one of your flashbacks to take the narrative back in time to describe how your preparation dealt with that problem. An adventuring party in Victorian London is investigating an elusive murderer. In an effort to capture them, the group takes a few days to take in the crime scene and prepare. Later, the group finds themselves deep in the sewers chasing after their quarry. In an effort to catch up to them, the mastermind of the group flashes back to purchasing a sewer map from a descendant of one of the original architects. The player marks off the cost of the map and uses it to corner the suspect and force a confrontation. Not every preparation is guaranteed to succeed, however. The GM is well within their rights to ask you to make a test of ability to see how well your preparation holds up, or even if things go well for you. An adventuring party plans to steal from a high security vault. They take a few days to case the joint. Later, the group is deep within the compound when they discover an impenetrable web of security lasers. The hacker flashes back to making preparations to temporarily disable the security. The GM asks them to roll to see if they're able to bypass the vault's security-- and for how long. The hacker manages a partial success-- long enough to get them in to grab what they needed, but not long enough to keep them from tripping the lasers on their way back out the door! No rewriting history It's important to note that flashbacks cannot rewrite history. If a guard sounded the alarm, no amount of flashing back to bribing them will undo that the alarm has been pressed. However, if the GM describes the alarm being pressed but hasn't yet described the flashing lights, it's totally valid for someone with tech savviness to cut in with a flashback to disabling the alarm system before the party made their way in. That said, don't be a jerk about this rule. The goal is to encourage a flow to the improvisational \"yes, and...\" of playing a roleplaying game, not to make every dramatic encounter a race to using a flashback before the GM finishes describing a new threat. GMs, give spaces for players to offer up flashbacks and prompt your players if you think they may have forgotten.

These recipes can also have any particular tools or environments that are required for your creative endeavor.

Dice are either stacked in your favor , which means you can roll them to improve your rolls or defenses, or they are stacked against you , which means other people can use them to improve their rolls against you. Just like with skills and backgrounds , the name of the stack is how you determine if it makes sense that you can take some dice from it. How do you stack dice? Whenever you try to create an advantage or disadvantage for yourself or someone else, you can make a test with the goal of stacking dice for or against someone . You might duck behind cover to be 2d8 Protected by Barricade , read up on a monster you're hunting to gain 4d6 Knowledge of Cockatrice Weaknesses , or appeal to the room with a suave remark to get 3d10 Favor of the Crowd . You can also stack dice by using abilities or equipment that say they stack dice for or against people. What size of dice are stacked depends on the quality of the advantage or disadvantage created. Hiding behind a rotting fence might only give you d4s, while positioning yourself behind concrete might give you d12s. Ultimately, this is a gamemaster call so if you're thinking about stacking dice, feel free to ask them what size of dice you'd be stacking before you try to do it. Your GM will likely stack dice when it makes sense ; automatically stacking dice for somebody when they start an action scene with the upper hand, or against somebody when they wade into a sucking bog. How do you use stacks? When you take dice off of a stack, you can either roll them to improve your roll for a test , or you can roll them to increase the difficulty of a test for somebody else. There's no limit to the number of dice that you can take from these stacks, as long as it makes sense that the stack would help you out on your test or make the other person's test more difficult. How long do stacks last? When the last die is taken from a stack, the stack is gone. If you had dice stacked against you, you have either recovered from the disadvantageous situation or figured out how to deal with it. If you had dice stacked in your favor, your tactical advantage might be no longer applicable or might simply no longer provide the benefits it once did. Your GM may also clear stacks whenever they no longer make sense . Being pinned down by covering fire only makes sense for as long as there's somebody out there actively raining down bullets on you-- if they get taken out or have to focus their attention elsewhere, that stack should go away. Stacks also probably shouldn't last longer than a session, but if it makes sense it's ok if they do. How do I get rid of dice stacked against me? Dice stacked against you can always be resisted. If you're 3d6 Tripped Up , you can make a test to regain your footing. If you're 1d12 Scared to Death you can make a test to steel yourself. When you do whatever makes sense to resist the dice stacked against you, you can make a test to remove dice from a stack . Examples of stacks 2d6 Inspirational Bravery is stacked in favor of the inspired and can be used whenever they could benefit from steeling their will. 4d10 Seeing Shadows is stacked against the afflicted and could be used by anyone who wants to use a character's hallucinations against them. 3d12 Cover behind the Parapets is stacked in favor of anyone behind the stone fortifications and could be used to defend against arrows and other dangers. 6d4 Waist Deep in Sewage is stacked against the hapless wader, and could be used by monsters lurking under the water or a sniper taking advantage of the character's slowed movements. Special Stacks Stacks, especially stacks created by abilities or equipment , can also have special rules associated with them. Here are some examples: 4d6 On Fire : At the start of your turn, remove a die from the stack and roll it to see how much damage you take from the flames. 3d12 Trapped by Rocks : You can't move until all the dice have been removed from this stack. 1d10 Berserker's Rage : As long as this stack is around, add another die to the stack whenever you take damage. There are no hard and fast rules on making special stacks, but most stacks probably shouldn't be special. Not only would making lots of stacks special mean lots of rules that everybody needs to remember, special stacks used in moderation give flair to specialized equipment (such as magic items, incendiary devices, or poisons) and powerful character abilities that wouldn't feel as awesome if being a special stack were more common.","title":"Dice Stacks"},{"location":"gameplay/stacks/#dice-stacks","text":"Dice stacks are a stack of dice of the same size with a name that describes them.

When they do, you'll look at your skills, legacies, and backgrounds and pick whichever feel appropriate to the situation. However, you can't pick more dice than your level plus the attribute you're testing. Note Maximum dice on a test = Your level + Attribute Once you've gathered those dice, you roll them, add them together, and tell your gamemaster what the final result is. They will compare that number against the difficulty of the test, Your gamemaster will then inform you if you failed or succeeded, and to what degree you succeeded. They might say you fail, partially succeed, fully succeed, or critically succeed at the test. If you didn't meet the difficulty, you fail . You won't get what you want and you might be in trouble. If you beat the difficulty, you partially succeed . You get what you want, but with some complication. If you beat the difficulty by 10 or more, you fully succeed . you get exactly what you want. If you beat the difficulty by 20 or more, you critically succeed ! Not only do you get what you want, you get all that and more.

Visualizing Tests You don't usually need to write out a test and its outcomes, but if you if you did it would look something like this: Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant Difficulty 15 Test of Presence Goal: Turning a profit on contraband Drama: The merchant might be insulted or involve the authorities If they... Fail: the merchant gets indignant and starts making a scene. The authorities are sure to get involved immediately. Partially succeed: the merchant agrees to buy the contraband, but it seems like they're not likely to want to see you again. They may tip off the authorities, but not until after you've left. Fully succeed: you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal Critically succeed: not only does the merchant accept the deal but they happen to know a great fence in the area and look forward to working with you again Example of a Test Let's bring it all together and walk through a test of ability using the Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant example above: A thief character attempts to turn a profit on some contraband . Since this is an action that carries the risk of the merchant becoming upset or involving the authorities and some uncertainty between which of the goal and the risk will occur, the gamemaster calls for a test of ability. Given the social nature of the action, the gamemaster says that convincing the merchant is going to be a test of Presence and secretly marks down a difficulty of 15 , since they rule that this requires professional expertise. On the thief's character sheet are the backgrounds Smuggler and Mercenary , as well as the skills, Acrobatics , Lockpicking , and Intimidation . Based on their current goal, they choose their background Smuggler , and their skill Intimidation as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation. The gamemaster agrees that these are good choices, so the thief rolls their 1d10 Presence, 1d6 Intimidation, and 1d12 for their Smuggler background. They roll a 10, a 5, and a 5 for a total of 20-- a spectacular roll. They have a +5 attribute modifier to their Presence, bringing the total of the roll up to 25. The difficulty of the test was 15 , and 25 is 10 higher than the difficulty, which makes it a full success . According to the test, you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal . Based on the skills used, the gamemaster now has everything they need to paint a picture of how the sweating merchant responds to the smuggler's intimidation and ultimately gives in.","title":"Testing Abilities"},{"location":"gameplay/tests/#testing-abilities","text":"When you try to do something and there's drama involved with whether or not you can do what you try to do, your gamemaster will ask you to \"test\" the attribute that makes the most sense for the situation.

However, you can't pick more dice than your level plus the attribute you're testing.

Dice Size In Simply Roleplaying, the four sided die (1d4), six sided die (1d6), eight sided die (1d8), ten sided die (1d10), and twelve sided die (1d12) are the most commonly used dice. Usually, you progress from 1d4 to 1d6 to 1d8 and so on. For this reason, Simply Roleplaying uses a tabletop roleplaying concept where the dice are described by size -- the more sides the die has, the \"bigger\" it's considered to be. Generally, dice size is used to compare dice. A d10 is bigger than a d8 and a d4 is smaller than a d6. Sometimes in Simply Roleplaying a rule will refer to \"the next biggest\" or \"the next smallest\" size of a die. In that case, just remember that unless the rule says otherwise, dice can only be 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, or 1d12-- there is no die bigger than 1d12 or smaller than 1d4. Movement Unlike other popular roleplaying games, Simply Roleplaying does not define strict rules for how many feet a character can move in a handful of seconds. Instead, Simply Roleplaying defines distances in \"spaces,\" which could be a 70px square on your favorite Virtual TableTop, one-inch hex on your dining room table, inches on a measuring tape, or whatever else you want to use to represent spaces. The important thing is that they're all a relative gauge of distance to each other. Feel free to come up with your own measurement for how big a space is in the game -- popular fantasy roleplaying games suggest that a space is usually about 5 ft / 1.5 m. Narrative Truth Sometimes the rules of Simply Roleplaying will say that something happens \"when it makes sense.\" This is a simple way of saying \"when the story we're telling together says it should happen.\" Certainly a character would heal from their wounds after some downtime recovering, but they might also heal from a healing spring that cures all wounds. Generally what \"makes sense\" is obvious. When it's not obvious, what makes sense should be a conversation between players and the gamemaster.","title":"Some basics"},{"location":"getting_started/#some-basics","text":"Before you dive straight into Simply Roleplaying, there are a few common mechanics in the system to understand.","title":"Some basics"},{"location":"getting_started/#dice-size","text":"In Simply Roleplaying, the four sided die (1d4), six sided die (1d6), eight sided die (1d8), ten sided die (1d10), and twelve sided die (1d12) are the most commonly used dice.

That said, gamemasters, you should read this as well-- it might even be good to read it aloud to your players at the table. Creating a character is all about dreaming up a concept, then figuring out how to realize it mechanically. There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character. If you're new to roleplaying games in general, you may want to start by writing an answer to each of the headings before you read the text under them. What comes naturally to you? Your starting speed is 6 spaces . This is how many spaces you can move with an action . In addition, all characters have intrinsic attributes about them that make it easier or harder for them to do specific things. Read up on attributes , then pick two attributes to specialize in and set them to +1. Gamemasters, if players are starting at a level higher than 1 their starting attributes should add up to twice their starting level -- they can distribute these attributes however they want, but make sure they're adhering to the attribute level cap . How much stress can you handle? Once you've done that, it's time to calculate the maximum amount of damage your character can sustain. Read up on health, damage, and injuries , then set your starting health to 24. What is your story? Think about where in the campaign world you come from, and why you are seeking out to adventure with your fellow players. Then, read up on skills and backgrounds and choose to either make a background or start brimming with potential . If you chose to make a background , write a background that summarizes your character's story so far. If you chose to start brimming with potential , your gamemaster will allot you with a starting pool of 5 points of potential to spend on skills as you progress. Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish. If a player doesn't want to make all of the starting backgrounds, they can instead choose to take 5 points of potential per background they would have created. What do you have with you? Think about what possessions your character might have and write them down. This doesn't have to be an exhaustive list, but it should probably cover most things that you'd use to showcase what cool stuff your character can do. From bedrolls to mp3 players, what a character might carry with them in their day-to-day speaks a lot to who they are and where they come from. Consider writing down a sentimental object such as a an old, handwritten journal or a locket carrying an irreplaceable lock of grey hair. Once you've finished figuring out what you've got, read up on equipment and add equipment tags to anything that would benefit from having them. Be sure to talk to your gamemaster about the equipment and tags you've chosen. If your campaign is going to be combat focused, it's probably a good idea to have something with the Weapon tag and something with the Armor tag. Examples A cavern explorer might have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, and a grappling hook (close-range). A starship diplomat might have things like a universal translator, fine clothes, id card, hologram computer, a wax seal kit, and a handful of fountain pens. What makes you unique? Read up on abilities and ability points, and consider what type of ability points make sense for your character. Then work with your GM to pick or create an ability for your character. Once you've done that, choose one: * Give yourself another ability and add a point to your maximum ability points * Pick something cool and unique to have as equipment-- something useful or mysterious that most people wouldn't have. Give it at least a +1 tag. * Increase your health by 12. * Create a helper or ally companion to assist your character What do you look like? Describe your character! What's their heritage? Are they young or old? Thick or scrawny? What color skin? Eyes? Hair? What colors of clothing do they wear? How does their equipment look on them? Is it shiny and new? Dingy and poorly cared for? Ill fitting? Tailor-made? Be sure to pick a defining visual characteristic or two that highlights their history or personality. What is your name? Now that you know everything about them, what kind of a name fits your character? Do they use their full name or a nickname? Do they know their family name? Are they proud of it?

Picking the Difficulty So how do you choose the specific number that your players roll against? First of all, you have to know what attribute you're testing, and what the player's level is in that attribute. Your players should have that on their character sheet, but if they don't you can just add their attribute modifier to their character level and that'll give you Check out the table below to see a rough mapping from an attribute's level to the difficulty of a test that will challenge it. Attribute level Test Difficulty 1 5 4 25 7 45 10 65 13 85 15 100 17 110 20 130 This is a good rule of thumb for your players power. However, you may notice that this table goes up to 20-- what the heck? Aren't players only supposed to go up to level 10, and their attributes up to +5? How could they possibly reach Level 20? The thing about this table is it's not going to be totally accurate to your party. It's a good rule of thumb, but as your players gather strong equipment and learn powerful abilities , they'll start rolling even higher than you might expect! Once they start doing so consistently, it's probably best to start keeping track of the level that your characters roll like in addition to the level they have on their character sheet, just so you know for planning purposes. Competitions However, not all tests have a level-- it's also perfectly valid for a test to be a roll off between the involved characters. Take an arm wrestling contest with, for example -- it would be a test of brawn, and both players would roll against each other. The outcome of the test, then, comes from comparing the rolls rather than comparing the roll to a static number. In the rare event of a tie in a competition, everybody involved in the tie should either fail or partially succeed, depending on what makes sense to you. When you're dealing with three or more people involved in the same competition, it's probably best to abandon the idea of failing or succeeding entirely. Instead, judge how characters did by ranking them from highest to lowest roll. Offer Hard Choices when there are Multiple Risks Lots of tests may have multiple risks involved. Chasing after a bad guy through a crowded alley in an unfamiliar city might have both the risk of letting them get away and getting lost in a part of town you don't know. While it's perfectly reasonable for a failure on a test to mean \"all of the bad stuff that could happen, does happen\" consider also offering hard choices to your players on which bad stuff might happen when they fail or partially succeed. Progress Meters If your players are trying to do something and you just don't think they can do something like that in just one test, you can instead pick a target number and create a progress meter to track the effort spent. A progress meter starts at 0 and ends at whatever target number you set it at. Whenever your players roll on tests that contribute to the goal of the progress meter, add their roll to the progress meter to fill it up! Once the progress meter hits the number you targetted, the goal is accomplished! Optionally, you can also have additional \"stretch goals\" at further target numbers if your players want to keep going. Good Tests A test is fundamentally useless without a goal , a risk , and an uncertainty . Without uncertainty, the narrative already clearly indicates what will happen, so it should just happen. Without a goal, the roller's agency is subverted-- if they don't know what they're trying to do, the number rolled doesn't mean anything to them. Without a risk, failure has no cost and the test is drained of tension. At best, it's boring-- at worst it's frustrating. This is not to say that tests need always be dramatic or life-changing-- changing the lettering of a sign to prank a party member is as valid a goal as crossing a precarious bridge. Getting caught by said party member in the middle of defacing a street sign is still a risk, it's just a less obvious one than tumbling off of that precarious bridge. The concept of goals and risks is something that relies on the players being immersed in their character, their surroundings, and the world at large. If you're playing with a bunch of people new to the system, take some time in an introductory dungeon to help your players think in terms of the goals they want to perform and the risks that might come with them. Goal Guidelines Goals are a statement of intent and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. This is the part of tests that fall on the players to define. You should be prepared to ask questions until you are absolutely certain of the intention of the player's actions. If a player doesn't know what they are trying to do in the situation, consider presenting a few options like in a choose-your-own-adventure novel. Risk Guidelines Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as taking a terrible injury, and should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Even something as apparently riskless as failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night, missing a crucial detail, or getting a fact wrong.","title":"Creating Tests"},{"location":"running_the_game/creating_tests/#creating-tests","text":"I'm assuming you've already read the players rules on tests -- if you haven't, I'd start there and then come back here and we can break down how to make them.","title":"Creating Tests"},{"location":"running_the_game/creating_tests/#picking-the-difficulty","text":"So how do you choose the specific number that your players roll against?

A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Even something as apparently riskless as failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night, missing a crucial detail, or getting a fact wrong.","title":"Risk Guidelines"},{"location":"setting_rules/","text":"Setting Rules Not every setting plays by the same rules.

They're all forms of extranormal powers . Here's a way you can achieve powers in Simply Roleplaying using appropriately named Skills/Backgrounds, Abilities, and Equipment. What can Powers Do? By their very nature, powers almost always allow their wielder to do things that would otherwise be impossible. Creating flame from nothing, communicating over vast distances, or teleportation are all things that are typically accomplishable with the right powers. How do Powers Work? Powers, just like anything else significant that a character does, often require a test of ability to use. The skills and backgrounds required to wield them tend to describe the power; a pyromancy skill allows the wielder to manipulate fire, a telepathy skill allows them to speak into the minds of others, and a gravitational manipulation skill allows them manipulate gravity. That said, just having the pyromancy skill doesn't necessarily give you control over flame. Usually you'll need an ability, a piece of equipment, or some combination of both to do that. Powers and Abilities Powers are extraordinary and unique things that a character can do. If this sounds a lot like an ability, you're right! The root of almost every power is an Ability that allows you to do something narratively extraordinary . Specifically, it's often a good idea to have a base level ability that gives you some sway over your power. Take this Ability, for instance: Pyromancer When you have equipment tagged with Focus and Pyromancy , you can conjure and control flame through the pyromancy skill. Your GM may ask you to spend ability points on particularly large or complicated effects. Characters without that ability could still learn and use the pyromancy skill to represent their knowledge of how pyromancy works or its history, but only those with that ability could use it to literally move fire. In addition, you'll often want to create abilities for some of the extraordinary things you can do with your powers. Pyromancer will let you perform tests of abilities to control flames, but creating an explosion or summoning a fire elemental are likely the domain of a supplementary ability! Powers and Equipment Equipment with the tag focus and tagged with one or more extranormal powers will either allow the wielder to use that particular power or enhance their control over the power. It might strengthen the power, reduce the requirements for using the power at all, or mitigate the usual risks that the power has. Focuses take many shapes. Magicians might have wands, cauldrons, or spellbooks. Superheroes might have rings, hammers, or gadgets. Psionics might have emitters, inhibitors, or focusing helmets. Focuses also have an attribute tag to determine which attribute you use to exert your power. Usually this is a mental attribute; Intuition focuses might be used for powers dealing with the slippery minds of others, Knowledge focuses might be used for powers that require intense study like harnessing the mathematical formulas required to manifest elemental forces, and Will focuses might be used for manifesting power drawn from a covenant or divinity. Naming Powers and their Skills Unless your setting encourages particularly broad skills, your gamemaster may want you to avoid more ambiguously named skills like magic or super-powers and instead focus on specifics. A good rule of thumb is to think of a particular thing to have power over and use that as the description of the skill. Your gamemaster should be able to help you figure out what a good skill would be to represent the power you want in their setting. Further Limiting Powers Without powers, skills and backgrounds tend to be limited by what we can suspend our disbelief that the character we're playing can do. For instance; no matter how stealthy you are, you still can't hide in broad daylight. It's much easier to suspend our disbelief with made-up powers, so they can easily become the most useful thing in a campaign! If you find that powers are taking over your game, or if you want a particular power to be more difficult to harness, consider making the power(s) in question dangerous. Dangerous Powers Dangerous powers carry greater risks than doing something without them. The power may have chance of going wrong or be strenuous to use, meaning the very act of using those powers in a test may have their own negative consequences. For powers with risks, the scale of what the power is being used to do usually increases the scale of the risk. Levitating a pebble might take a moment of concentration where levitating a boulder would be exhausting and levitating a mountain might take so much out of you it could kill you if you tried. Here's an example of implementing a risk of exhaustion into a strenuous use of power: Growing a Tree with Nature Magic Difficulty 30 Test of Knowledge Goal: Growing a tree from a sapling to a fully grown oak Risk: Expediting life takes its toll, exhausting you If they... Fail: the tree may grow, but it takes far more energy than you expected. Take 30 damage from the toll of your magic. Partially succeed: the tree grows, but it drains your energy to do so. Take 15 damage from the toll of your magic. Fully succeed: you coax life to grow faster than it normally would, growing the sapling to a mighty oak. Take 5 damage from the toll of your magic. Critically succeed: the tree grows at your will without costing you anything at all Example Powers Some powers that a character might use their Knowledge for are: Pyromancy , from lighting torches to raging bonfire Telekinesis , moving stuff with your mind Metal bending , iron, steel, brass and lead all bend for you like clay Magnetism manipulation , how does it work? Some powers that a character might use their Intuition for are: Fear manipulation , the amount of times one picks flight over fight Telepathy , the ability to convey thoughts into the minds of others Scrying , the ability to see distant people and places Mind reading , the ability to pluck thoughts from the minds of others Some covenants and divinities that a character might use their Will to manifest miracles from are: Magnusancte , whose brilliant magic judges both the target and the wielder Bloodfrost , the art of the Thorns of the Red Ringed Rose that can only be conjured by inflicting suffering upon oneself Floras , the anima of a grove of trees with healing fruits Pureum , the Hexadivinite lady of the purple robe, whose chaotic nature can be used to dispel magic","title":"Powers"},{"location":"setting_rules/powers/#powers","text":"Magic is a common tool in high fantasy, superhero fiction, and science fiction-- it goes by different names depending on your exact setting, but the rules presented here should work for anything from magic spells to super powers to psionics.
