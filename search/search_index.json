There were six players, ranging from people who had lots of experience with TTRPGs to people who had only ever heard of roleplaying. At the time I was running two weekly campaigns and I was eager to play-- there was just one problem. I didn't have any of the books for the system I had been running. All I had was a single set of polyhedral dice. So I winged it. I used the d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 as the way to distribute character strengths and weaknesses, decided on five categories (Agility, Brawn, Mental, Charisma, and Luck), and had each player distribute the five dice between them. For character creation, I gave them a quick writing prompt of \"You're in prison, about to be executed. What are you accused of?\" to chew on while we played and we got to the business of playing the game -- starting with a jailbreak. The one-shot turned into a campaign and it became clear that the system worked for my players, but it needed to develop to handle progression and other elements that the longer-length nature of a campaign promised. As players asked me for systems to do certain things, I improvised ways it could be done. Whatever worked, stuck. If you asked me, I'd say the system as it is now is still a work in progress -- it's been through many revisions and there are still elements of it that I'm not happy with. However, no matter how much my art-is-never-truly-finished brain really wants to protest it, it is ready to be run by people other than me. So, here it is. If I had to say one thing about the design of my system, it's that how simple that first session was to set up and go sticks with me. No matter how much I add to the system I will always endeavor to make sure that others can still recreate that magic with their players, should they wish to. About Me Hey! I'm Richard. When I was younger, I loved to tinker with the rules for any board game I played. Sometimes before I had even finished playing them through once! When I joined my parents' AD&D group, I started writing rule supplements for doing things that I thought would be cool, like overhauling the process for crafting and enchanting a weapon. I started putting pen to paper on my own games and systems in middle school. Any system I made was something that needed to be simple enough to be played on a whim at the lunch table or on a campout-- so that meant no dice or character sheets, let alone prep material. As a result, the systems I made were heavily narratively focused and had few mechanics beyond my players describing what they wanted to do and me improvising a world in response. In high school I built out a simple system with proper mechanics that was heavily inspired by Fire Emblem, and in college I started devouring other systems to learn from all the cool stuff that's out there! Outside of roleplaying games, I dig video games and I have a rather sizeable collection of board games of which I'm proud to say there are only a few that I've never played. I also \"spend a lot of time thinking about time\" as my roommate puts it-- there's something about having a good todo list and time tracker going that just really helps me keep everything in my life running smoothly.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-simply-roleplaying","text":"Simply Roleplaying started in 2013 at a friend's birthday party in college when somebody suggested I run a one-shot session.

A character in Simply Roleplaying is made up of several different pieces. If you're creating a character for the first time, you may want to check out the walkthrough in character creation . The content on this page and that page are almost the same, this one is just aimed at breaking everything on your character sheet down while that page is aimed at walking you through setting it up. Total Dice Total dice represents your general power level. This is the number of dice you can roll from your skills, legacies, and backgrounds. Health and Injuries Health is how much damage you can take before you suffer an injury . Injuries take time to recover from, and if you take too many you'll be defeated and the worst of the bad stuff will happen to you. Attributes Attributes are broad categories which represent your strengths and weaknesses-- your physical strength, ability to quickly respond, willpower, and more. Any time you make a test of ability , it'll test a specific attribute and you'll add that attribute to whatever you rolled. You also have passive attribute scores that you use instead of dice for when you respond reflexively to that attribute being tested. Skills, Legacies, and Backgrounds Skills, Legacies, and Backgrounds are the individual pieces that make up who you are and what you've learned. Skills describe what you know how to do-- they're anything concrete that you can get better at, given practice. Legacies describe your reputation-- they're your values, the factions you've allied with, and the deeds you've done. Backgrounds describe you-- they're built from Skills and Legacies put together and summarized. Abilities Abilities are the unique and cool things your character can do. Casting magic, building inventions, or memorizing crucial details all can go here. Ability points are a pool of points that you can spend on doing cool ability stuff. Inventory Your inventory is filled with all the stuff you own. Anything you can use to accomplish a task is usually a piece of equipment and has tags that describe its properties. Items in your inventory are either equipped or not-- equipped items are usually visible and easy to get to, unequipped items are stored away somewhere on your person. Companions Your companions are anyone else who travels with you, but doesn't need a full character sheet to represent them. A helper offers you the support of their skills. An ally has attributes, damage, and inventory of their own, but shares your total dice, injuries, skills, backgrounds, and abilities.","title":"What Makes Up a Character?"},{"location":"character/#what-makes-up-a-character","text":"A character in Simply Roleplaying is made up of several different pieces.

Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the weapon tag, their power over gravity allows them to temporarily lift massive objects, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details! This section is written assuming that players and GMs will work together to create cool abilities, but you can also decide to create and curate a list of abilities that characters are able to choose from and that's a fine way to play too! That's the way most TTRPGs work, after all. What do Abilities do? Abilities do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway. Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them. If you want to make an ability called Godmode that makes you immortal. Go for it. Just make sure you check with your GM and the rest of the table-- they may not want to play a TTRPG where somebody has cheat codes on. Of course, that's not to say that characters shouldn't be overpowered! Protagonists with the ability to shape the world to their whim can create a compelling story. Just make sure that everyone is on the same page and having fun, that's what matters. Ok, but what do they usually do? Often, a character's abilities will do things like: Inflict damage Make a test to heal damage Create bonus dice ...which could be special bonus dice Give some equipment a specific tag Allow someone to do something as if they had equipment with a specific tag Move the character where they want to be Move someone else where the character wants them to be Do something narratively extraordinary (for instance, using powers ) If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a Test of Ability to resist the effects, setting the Difficulty and describing what happens if they Critically Succeed , Succeed , Partially Succeed , or Fail . Requirements Every ability has requirements that must be met for you to be able to use it. The more requirements an ability has, or the more costly the requirements, the more powerful the ability should be. Often, requirements will be things like: Wielding a specific tool, like being required to use weapons specific to your art to use a martial arts technique Being in a specific situation, like being required to be defending against a melee attack to perform a counter Taking a specific amount of time, like being required to spend some downtime to create a potion Fulfilling a specific narrative goal, like being required to memorize a character's mannerisms to disguise yourself as them Spending a specific resource, like being required to spend mana to cast a spell (usually, spending ability points) Optional Requirements You can make an ability more flexible by making it stronger if more requirements are met. These optional requirements are often things like spending extra ability points, taking additional time, or fulfilling an extra goal. For instance: Craft a Disguise If you've spent at least one period of downtime every day for the last seven days observing a character, you can disguise yourself as that character. You automatically pass as them visually and at a distance. If you've spent at least two periods of downtime each day observing them, you better understand their mannerisms. You automatically pass as them when interacting with all but their closest friends. Ability Points Consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do? An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of ability points . If you're not sure, it's okay to just call them \"ability points\" and come up with a name for them later-- but it is a good idea to come up with a name for them later. It helps to make the flavor of your character come to life! You start with a pool of 2 of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you spend some downtime to recover . You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their mana from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their ammunition in an arsenal. A leader might replenish their pride from cheering throngs of admirers. Creating Multiple types of Ability Points Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their mana to use abilities related to their magic power might also have flourishes that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both ammunition for their arsenal of weapons and psi points . An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions. You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you only gain that many ability points in total-- you must choose which of your types of ability points increase. Customizing Ability Points If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it. If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities. Gaining Ability Points and Creating Abilities Every 10 potential you earn (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two. Any number of times between sessions you can reduce your maximum ability points by 1 to learn a new ability , or reduce your maximum ability points by 2 to improve an existing ability . If you happen to have multiple pools of ability points you may reduce any one of them by 1 to learn a new ability, or 2 to improve an existing ability. You can also reduce two of them by 1 to improve an existing ability. Similarly, between sessions you can remove abilities from your character sheet if you feel like they don't belong-- whether you just don't like how they work or if you feel like they don't make sense to your character anymore. If you do, make sure you increase your maximum ability points to compensate for the points you spent to earn that ability. If you made up new abilities or improvements, it's a good idea to make sure you take some time to talk them over with your table and/or your GM before you introduce them. Upgrading Abilities As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either give them an extra effect or make them stronger . Giving an Ability an Additional Effect Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. If an ability gave you an extra d6 when gathering information about a monster, giving it an extra effect might allow you to create a 1d6 bonus named I know [monster name] 's strengths and weaknesses as well. If an ability allowed you to give equipment the blessed and weapon tags, adding an extra effect might let you make a test of presence to heal the wielder too! Making an Ability Stronger If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. If an ability would push a target away from you, a stronger version of the ability might be able to push everyone within a close range of you away instead. If an ability would grant you an extra d4 when wielding weapons tagged with cleaving , a strengthened version of the ability might give you an extra d4 with cleaving or hooking -tagged weapons . Stronger abilities typically increase the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broaden the situations in which an ability might apply. Abilities Growing with Level When making an ability, you may not want all aspects of the ability to be improved by a player choosing to improve an ability -- increasing the difficulties for tests, the size of bonus dice, or the +X tag on ability-created equipment aren't things that necessarily feel rewarding to level up. Improving an ability should always feel like an improvement, it should never feel like keeping up. To that end, certain aspects of abilities should increase automatically as a character levels up. Bonus dice granted by an ability, for example, might start as d4s at level 1 and increase every two levels until level 8, when they become d12s. Test difficulties might increase by 10 every level. Here are some suggestions: Level Die Equipment Quality Test difficulty 1 1d4 +0 0 2 1d4 +1 10 3 1d6 +2 20 4 1d6 +3 30 5 1d8 +4 40 6 1d8 +5 50 7 1d10 +6 60 8 1d10 +7 70 9 1d12 +8 80 10+ 1d12 +9 90 You can also tie effects to things that are automatically improved every level like health, passive ability scores, and total dice. Let's Make Some Abilities All right, we've spent enough time talking about how they work. Let's make some ability points and an ability to use them. Tinkering Inventor What if our character was a Tinkering Inventor ? Someone who can always make the right tools for the job. Their abilities could be the inventions they create, powered by the scrap that the Inventor uses to make them. One ability could be Springloaded Boots -- a cobbled together contraption that allows the wearer to leap further and run faster... until it breaks. That's pretty easy to represent as bonus dice that the Inventor puts together over some downtime. Ability points: Scrap Ability: Springloaded Boots Requirements Effect By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can... ...give 1 target 4d4 bonus dice called Springloaded Boots. And upgrading it would probably mean making the boots last longer and be more durable, so we can just increase the number of bonus dice. Requirements Effect By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can... ...give 1 target 8 d4 bonus dice called Springloaded Boots. Alchemist What if our character was an Alchemist who produced poisons and potions? Their abilities could be the various potions effects they know how to make, powered by the concoctions that the Alchemist brews when the party rests. One ability could be a Health Potion that heals a bit of damage. Ability points: Concoctions Ability: Health Potion Requirements Effect By spending 1 concoction I can use an action to... ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach. We could then upgrade this potion to give it a secondary effect-- perhaps bonus dice for being invigorated? Requirements Effect By spending 1 concoction I can use an action to... ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach and give them 2d4 bonus dice called Invigorated . Unassuming Assassin What if our character was an Unassuming Assassin ? Someone small or frail who nonetheless is a lethal threat. Their abilities could be powered by their ability to mentally note their enemy's weak spots with assassin's marks . One ability could be Strike Their Weaknesses -- a technique to make attacks with anything based on intuitive analysis rather than strength or speed. Ability points: Assassin's Marks Ability: Strike Their Weaknesses Requirements Effect By spending an assassin's mark when I'm hidden from my target I can... ...make attacks as though my weapons had the intuition tag until the end of my turn. Upgrading this ability might allow us to add another tag, maybe the concealable tag. Requirements Effect By spending an assassin's mark when I'm hidden from my target I can... ...make attacks as though my weapons had the intuition and concealable tags until the end of my turn. Internet Savant What if our character was an Internet Savant who mastered the art of utilizing the collective human knowledge present on the web? Their abilities could be powered by their cellular data . A core ability of theirs could be There's a Wiki for That , because of course there is. Ability points: Cellular Data Ability: There's a Wiki for That Requirements Effect By spending a point of cellular data when I spend some downtime to research information I can... ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. Upgrading this ability might allow the Savant to utilize some tidbits they picked up when researching as bonus dice. Requirements Effect By spending a point of cellular data when I spend some downtime to research information I can... ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll and give myself 4d4 bonus dice named after what I researched. Street Brawler What if our character was a Street Brawler who was used to using anything at their disposal in a scrap? Their abilities could be powered by their reputation as a fighter. An ability of theirs could be Everything's a Weapon in My Hands , letting them improvise weapons from whatever they can grab. Ability points: Reputation Ability: Everything's a Weapon in My Hands Requirements Effect By spending a point of reputation when I'm using equipment without the weapon tag... ...I can give it the weapon tag for the scene. (The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one) Upgrading this ability could make those weapons more lethal by giving them an extra tag. Requirements Effect By spending a point of reputation when I'm using equipment without the weapon tag... ...I can give it the weapon tag for the scene. It also gets the +1 tag if it isn't already tagged with a bigger +X tag. (The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one) Improving an Ability Throughout a Campaign Here's a more in-detail example of how one could make an ability stronger over the course of multiple enhancements. Let's start with the ability Berserking Berserking Requirements Effect By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. A good starting point, but let's see if we can make it more interesting. The next chance we get to improve abilities, we choose to make the ability stronger . We can't increase the number of dice that we have, but we can change the dice into an bonus dice that can be used more than once. Since bonus dice are more broadly useful than just attacks, let's also change the trigger to an action. Berserking II Requirements Effect By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... ...create 2d4 bonus dice named Berserking for the scene. Already this is looking jucier. Now, not only do we get a 1d4 bonus to attacks, but we can also spend the dice from the bonus dice for breaking down doors, resisting mind control, and all kinds of other stuff that having Berserking bonus dice might help with. Where do we go from here? Well, a simple route would just be to increase the number of dice that we have on the Berserking bonus dice to get more Berserking Time, but what if we made them special bonus dice? We'd need our gamemaster's approval and their help making some balanced tweaks, but with their help we could come up with something like... Berserking III Requirements Effect By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... ...create 1d4 special bonus dice named Berserking for the scene. Berserking When you make an attack add 1d4 to these bonus dice. The first time you take damage each turn, add 1d4 to these bonus dice. If you end your turn without spending one of these bonus dice, they are all lost. This is what our gamemaster helped us come up with. They're special bonus dice that feeds themselves the more that we attack and take damage, but have the downside of needing to be used at least once on each of our turns or they go away. Now we're really getting somewhere! But... what if we could make it even better? Our gamemaster has an idea for that-- they say that if we want to, we can upgrade the ability again to remove the restriction that causes us to lose the bonus dice. Berserking IV Requirements Effect By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... ...create 1d4 special bonus dice named Berserking for the scene. Berserking When you make an attack add 1d4 to these bonus dice. The first time you take damage each turn, add 1d4 to these bonus dice. Wow. We are now three improvements deep into this ability and it feels pretty powerful indeed. By spending just one of our resources, we get powerful these dice that we can feed off of making attacks and taking damage, like a true berserker might. If we play our cards right, we'll be adding dice front, left, and center all battle long! Keeping it All \"Balanced\" Gamemasters, as you've been reading through this section you're probably wondering if there's some kind of behind-the-scenes mechanic for making a balanced ability. The short answer is: there isn't. The longer answer is there isn't, but not for a lack of trying. I spent quite some time working out various systems for point-buying your way to \"balanced\" abilities, but at the end of the day they all ended up being unbalanced in one way or another. After all, if you have an ability that gives you an extra d8 when you attack an undead enemy, how useful that ability is depends entirely on how often the GM pits you against undead enemies. If you have an ability to fly, how useful that ability is depends on how often you need to and couldn't otherwise. Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities as you go . If an ability feels too strong? Give it an extra requirement, or make one of its requirements more costly! If an ability feels too weak? Give it an extra effect or strengthen one of its existing effects without requiring the character to upgrade it.","title":"Abilities"},{"location":"character/abilities/#abilities","text":"Abilities are the cool mechanics that show off what makes your character awesome.

It helps to make the flavor of your character come to life! You start with a pool of 2 of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you spend some downtime to recover . You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their mana from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their ammunition in an arsenal. A leader might replenish their pride from cheering throngs of admirers.","title":"Ability Points"},{"location":"character/abilities/#creating-multiple-types-of-ability-points","text":"Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers.

An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions. You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have.

If you have an ability to fly, how useful that ability is depends on how often you need to and couldn't otherwise. Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities as you go . If an ability feels too strong?

Attributes are assigned an initial value in character creation and you can increase them by spending potential .

Having a d12 in Brawn means you're strong, but having a d12 in Brawn, a d8 in your Wrestling skill, a d10 Giant Wrestler legacy, and a background called The Thighcrusher paints quite the vivid picture. Skills represent trained capabilites, legacies represent things that you've done or you're known for, and backgrounds represent who your character is by combining several d12 skills and/or legacies together. Improving Skills and Legacies Every skill and legacy starts out at d4 and can grow to be as powerful as d12. Whenever you spend some downtime doing something that improves the skill or legacy, you can spend potential to acquire a skill or legacy you did not have, writing it down as a d4 skill or legacy, respectively, or to level up an existing skill or legacy to the next largest die size. Developing Skills Whenever you spend downtime to take some time to train or gain a flash of insight , you can spend potential to either learn a new skill that you do not have written down on your character sheet or to level up a skill that you do have written down on your character sheet. How a character takes some time to train varies from individual to individual, but usually involves several hours of downtime , a trainer, and/or suitable materials to study from. A character can act as a trainer for a skill provided that it pertains to one of their backgrounds. This means that a character can train themselves in a skill once they've incorporated it into a background! A character gains a flash of insight in the moment. You can declare you gain insight right before making a test of ability, right after, or even by watching someone else do something awesome. Whenever it makes sense, a player may declare that their character has gained insight in either a skill that was used or in a skill that could have been used in the situation. Earning Legacies Whenever you do something memorable or act like your reputation , you can spend potential to either start a new legacy that isn't written on your character sheet, or level up a legacy that you already have written down. Doing something memorable sounds broad, and that's because it is! Doing something memorable might be joining a faction, making an enemy, or saving a town. Any time you do anything that underscores your character's values in a way that other characters can talk about it, that's something memorable. Acting like your reputation is exactly what it sounds like. Whenever you do anything that your character is known to do, even if you haven't written it down on your character sheet yet, that's acting like your reputation. Renaming a Skill or Legacy Leveling up a skill or legacy can also be an opportunity to refine it. Whenever you level up a skill or legacy you can also rename it to better represent the skill or legacy that your character is developing. A character with the skill Spotting Traps narrowly avoids the last arrow trap of a dungeon and gains insight , spending a point of potential to level up the skill. As they reflect on how it might be less useful back above ground, they decide to rename the skill to Quick Reflexes as they level it up. A character with the legacy Wanted Pickpocket acts like their reputation and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy by formally accepting membership to the Blackgrass Thieves' Guild. Not wanting to limit themselves to picking pockets, they change the name of the legacy to Blackgrass Thieves' Guild Member . A character with the skill Research spends days trying to crack the secrets of an alien artifact, working with a librarian to help train them in getting better at researching. To represent both the newfound knowledge and to help them get more specific answers in the future, they decide to rename the skill to Extraterrestrial Research as they level it up. A character with the legacy Monster Hunter does something memorable by landing the killing blow on the dragon who has been terrorizing the countryside and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy. Since slaying a dragon is surely more impressive than the other creatures they've defeated, they decide they'd rather the legacy be named Dragonslayer . Abandoning a Skill or Legacy Sometimes a skill or legacy might not work out for your character. Maybe it was too specific, just isn't very useful in the long term, or your character has had a shift in priorities such that what you wrote down no longer makes sense for them. In that case, you can always choose to forget . During any period of downtime , you may decrease the die level of one of your skills or legacies to reclaim one point of potential. This can represent the public's waning attention to your deeds in the case of a legacy, or your character losing interest in or forgetting about that skill in preparation to learn something new. Building a Background Once a character has three related d12 skills and/or legacies, they can take a few hours of downtime to reflect and combine them together to form a background that summarizes the aspect of the character that is reflected by those three skills and/or legacies. Backgrounds can be added to any test that their name implies that they would be useful for and are worth a d12 when added to a test. A character has a d12 in the skills Acrobatics and Lockpicking as well as a d12 in the legacy Robs from the rich to feed the poor , it would make sense for them to be able to combine them together into a background called Robin Hood of Crookshack Row . When a character develops a new background, the skills and legacies combined into that background are erased from their character sheet, as their new background includes those skills/legacies. If a character wishes to, they can start legacies or learn skills with the same name again. If they do, these new legacies and skills represent additional reputations and capabilities beyond what their backgrounds describe. Leveling up Backgrounds If a character has three d12 skills and/or legacies that are related to one of their existing backgrounds, instead of creating a new background they can choose to level an existing background up. Higher leveled backgrounds can be used multiple times on a test, up to a number of times equal to their level. To level up a background, a character takes a few hours of downtime and erases the three related d12 skills and/or legacies, just like when creating a background. Then, they rename the background to represent the expertise gained and mark down the new level of the background. A roguish character with the Robin Hood of Crookshack Row background has a d12 in the legacy Thief of Luiena's Crown , as well as a d12 in the skills Sneaking and Traps . These skills and legacies all are relevant to the Robin Hood of Crookshack Row background so rather than add a new background they choose to level up their existing background to Crownthief of Staedbergh (Level 2) . Renaming a Background Characters change. Getting better at the stuff your backgrounds reflect can be easily shown by creating new backgrounds that represent the new skills you've learned. However, sometimes it makes sense for the name of a background to change to better reflect the character that it's representing. A Bloodthirsty Warlord may become a Repentant General , an Assassin for Hire may become a Silencer of the Court , or a Master Blacksmith might become the Silversmith of Ardent . Sometimes the change is less story driven and more that you've come up with a better name to describe that grouping of skills. That's fine too! Backgrounds should be renamed until you're happy with them. After all, backgrounds exist to express your character. Naming Guidelines The trickiest part about being able to create your own skills or backgrounds is coming up with a good name. You want your names to keep a balance between the general and the specific. Ideally, your skills, legacies, and backgrounds should be expressive of what you want your character to be able to do while still remaining general enough that they can come up a lot in play. Don't worry too much about coming up with the perfect name, it's often good enough to just create a good name. Skills and legacies are just the building blocks of backgrounds and backgrounds should be renamed until they feel right. Naming a Skill Names for skills are fairly rigid. Skills should describe a specific thing that your character has trained in. The more general the name of a skill is, the more generic the character's expertise is considered to be. A character with a History skill would be able to apply it to broad questions about the past of a town, but wouldn't likely be able to apply that knowledge to find the age of the ancient catacombs under the town like a character with an Archeology skill. Conversely, a character with an Archeology skill wouldn't likely be able to apply it to uncovering facts about the recent political unrest of the town. Naming a Legacy Legacy names should focus on your character's reputation and things they've done, but should also represent the developing nature of the legacy. Legacies can be a phrase describing your displayed values, a title awarded, or anything else that showcases your budding reputation. Legacies are also a great space for representing ranks in factions-- joining any faction and advancing in rank are both definitely doing something memorable, and acting in line for that faction will always be acting like your reputation. Since the way that you level up your legacies is by doing something memorable and acting like your reputation , make sure to think about how you'll level up your legacy as you write it down! Robbed a noble can likely only be leveled up whenever you rob someone or talk about how you did, but Steals from the rich to feed the poor can be leveled up in that way and whenever you perform an act of charity! Naming a Background Names for backgrounds are more freeform. A good rule of thumb is to name your background something that you might use in a sentence to describe your character. Backgrounds could be jobs like Blacksmith , Hacker , or Guerilla Sniper , roles like Healer , Tactician , or Tank , or even quick descriptions like Born in a Port City , Penny Pincher , or Iron Will . Really, there's not much of a definition for what a background can or can't be; if it sums up both an aspect of your character and a spectrum of skills, it's probably a good background! Additional Examples Here are some additional examples of skills based on a attribute they work well with, and some background examples of how they might be combined. While skills are never limited by what attribute you use them with, sometimes thinking about what attribute you want to improve will help you decide on what kind of skill to learn. Skills to augment Agility tests primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are Acrobatics , Rubix Cube Solving , and Sneaking . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Criminal Mastermind . Skills to augment Brawn tests primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples are Breaching Doors , Lifting , and Swimming . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Military Commando . Skills to augment Intuition tests primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples are Driving , Gambling , and Streetwise . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Getaway Driver . Skills to augment Knowledge tests primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples are Bandit Culture , Political History , and Sewing . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Gang Savvy Granny . Skills to augment Presence tests primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples are Animal Handling , Bluff , and Political Appeal . If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named Druid Politician . Skills to augment Will tests primarily focus on a character's ability to shut out distractions or act despite hardship. Some examples are Acting under Pressure , Ignoring Pain , and Spirit .

A character can act as a trainer for a skill provided that it pertains to one of their backgrounds. This means that a character can train themselves in a skill once they've incorporated it into a background! A character gains a flash of insight in the moment. You can declare you gain insight right before making a test of ability, right after, or even by watching someone else do something awesome.

As they reflect on how it might be less useful back above ground, they decide to rename the skill to Quick Reflexes as they level it up. A character with the legacy Wanted Pickpocket acts like their reputation and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy by formally accepting membership to the Blackgrass Thieves' Guild.

When a character develops a new background, the skills and legacies combined into that background are erased from their character sheet, as their new background includes those skills/legacies.

Legacies are also a great space for representing ranks in factions-- joining any faction and advancing in rank are both definitely doing something memorable, and acting in line for that faction will always be acting like your reputation. Since the way that you level up your legacies is by doing something memorable and acting like your reputation , make sure to think about how you'll level up your legacy as you write it down!

Injuries Injuries are lasting physical or mental consequence that bring a character closer to death. Whenever a character suffers an injury: erase all damage taken so far, mark an injury box, and if the line next to it is blank, write a brief description of the injury. While the gamemaster ultimately has final say over what the injury is, any player can offer a suggestion for what kind of an injury a character may have taken. Some examples of injuries are a fractured wrist from blocking a crushing mace blow, exhaustion following an inventing all-nighter, or a shoulder bite to the bone from a rat of unusual size. Defeat If a character suffers an injury when all of their injury boxes are marked, their injuries have caught up to them and they are defeated . What that means depends on the situation; they might have been paralyzed by fear, captured, swallowed, traumatized... they might even be dead. Whatever happened, they're out of the action until the end of the scene and should probably take some downtime to recover. Defeat and Death Gamemasters, defeat can mean death for a character but it shouldn't always. In fact, it should probably only mean death when that propels the story forward in an interesting way. If the defeat is for one of your players, this should count double. Always check with your players before putting their character's life on the line-- the threat of death can be a compelling and interesting aspect of a campaign, but when it happens abruptly due to a few bad rolls it can do more to harm the game than help it. Recovering If a character rests , they restore their health to full. Whenever the character spends some downtime resting, they may additionally erase all marked injury boxes on their character sheets. If the rest was enough to fully heal the injury, erase the description next to the marked injury box. Otherwise, keep it around or rename it to reflect the healing process. Recovering doesn't mean those wounds have completely healed, just that they are healed enough that they are no longer bringing your character closer to a life-threatening injury. If you need to check that injury box again, it means those wounds reopened. Healing Healing is a way of expediting the process of recovery. If a character receives medical treatment for one of their injuries over a short time they may erase the marked injury box from their character sheet in addition to erasing all of their accumulated damage. Your gamemaster may rule that a character must have access to medical supplies appropriate for treating the injury and/or that they must make a test of knowledge to treat the injury.","title":"Damage and Injuries"},{"location":"character/health/#damage-and-injuries","text":"","title":"Damage and Injuries"},{"location":"character/health/#damage","text":"Damage is the amount of energy that a character has to handle strenuous and dangerous things.

Action scenarios are so named because they are the stuff that action movies are full of. Action scenarios are turn based and typically follow the same rules, however some types of action scenarios may define special things you can do with your actions that fit the theme of the scenario. Who Goes When Action scenarios are turn based and take place over blocks of time referred to as rounds . A full round usually is considered to take ten seconds of game time, but gamemasters may adjust this based on what makes sense for the action scenario. Most of the time, each character involved in the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking a turn in a specific order. Roll Order There are several ways of determining the character order in rounds, the most iconic in tabletop games is rolling for initiative and acting in an order based on that role. To act in Roll Order , at the beginning of the action scenario each participant is involved in a competition of Intuition , then take their turns in the order they are ranked. Keep track of the results made for this competition. After all characters have taken their turn (otherwise known as the end of the round ), characters outside of the action scenario can make their own roll for the competition of Inutition, and are added to the initiative order in the position determined by their roll. Roll Order: Delaying your turn Sometimes a character will wish to take their turn at a later time. Perhaps the room has filled with smoke and they're waiting for a clear shot, or the enemy mage is about to cast a spell and they want to wait out the attack. In whatever case this might be, the character may choose to delay their turn until a later time in the round. Before any character with a lower initiative score takes their turn, the delayed character may take their turn. If more than one character are delaying their turns at the same time, each character is given the opportunity to take their delayed turn in initiative order. If a character is delaying their turn at the end of the round, they are given one final opportunity to take their turn. Delayed turns cannot carry over between rounds. Popcorn Order The following is adapted from the ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post Accidentally Designing Marvel\u2019s Action Order System . Popcorn Order allows for a more teamwork-centric and tactical approach to initiative order by giving each character the ability to determine who acts after them. Just like in initiative order, each participant takes part in a competition of Intuition . However, unlike in initiative order, instead of ordering participants from highest roll to lowest roll, the highest roller is declared the first to act. In the case of an ambush, tensions broken by the first shot fired, or some other situation where it is clear who will (or has) acted first gamemasters may opt to skip rolling and instead start the turn order with that character. Then, after each participant finishes their turn, they choose another participant who has not taken a turn yet this round to be the next to take their turn. If another character interrupts the turn order the chosen character does not take their turn. Instead, the interrupting character may take their turn if they have not already done so in this round, then choose the next participant to act. Once all participants in a round have taken their turn, characters who are not participants in the combat can become participants. Then, the last participant to take a turn in the round chooses the participant starts the next round. Popcorn Order in Practice Gamemasters, if you intend to use Popcorn Order you should be aware of its tactical advantages and disadvantages. One question you will likely be asked immediately is \"why would I ever pass to an enemy?\" The answer here lies in vying for control of the end of the round, since the decides the order of the next round. Used cleverly, this can allow key players or even the entire team the opportunity to take two uninterrupted turns in a row-- one at the end of the round, and one at the start of the next round. In addition, making sure that the enemies of the combat are clearly distinct so your players can easily identify who they are choosing to go next. If you have a bunch of largely indistinguishable non-player characters, consider clearly defining squads of those non-player characters. Squads are simply made up of characters that will always pass their action to another character in their \"squad\" until none are available. this helps your players (and you!) so the turn can be passed to \"the bandits\" instead of needing to specify which specific bandit they're referring to. Actions On their turn each character can take up to 3 actions . One action on its own can be used to do something quick that does not require much complex thought. Running a short distance, making an attack, jumping a gap, climbing a ladder, hiding behind a pillar, or triggering a mechanism are all examples of actions. Moving Your Speed Every character (and some objects) have a speed . When a character uses their action to move, they can move a distance up to their speed. This movement might be sprinting, running and leaping, swimming, riding a horse, or driving a car. Obviously, not all distances are made equal-- if something about the distance you're crossing requires you to slow down , you only can move up to half of your speed with that action. Spending Multiple Actions A character can spend multiple actions in succession to do something complicated or time consuming. Casting a spell, repairing broken machinery, deciphering a complicated message, rolling a boulder out of the way, or hacking a computer terminal are examples of things that might take multiple actions. If the character does not have enough actions to do something completely, they can still spend what actions they have towards the total cost of whatever they want to do. Until the full cost is paid, they are considered to be focusing on it. If they use an action to do anything else, their progress is lost. If it makes sense, a character who is focusing on doing something can be helped by other characters on their turns, allowing the group to speed up the process of doing something particularly complicated or time consuming by working together. Reactions In addition to the actions that they can perform on their turn, characters can also react to another character's action, performing one action in response. Characters can only react once per round. If they do not react by the start of their next turn, they may perform one extra action on that turn. Some examples of reactions are ducking behind cover, dodging away from a fatal blow, closing a door, or activating a simple mechanism. Defining Scenario-Specific Actions: Chases Sometimes it can be helpful to define specific actions that can be taken in an action scenario if they better serve the feeling of the scenario. Chases, for instace, are a special kind of action scenario that capture the fast back-and-forth between participants in a race. Unlike other action scenarios, there's no reacting in chases. In addition, there are several special actions that can be performed in a chase, detailed here . Freeform Action Scenarios The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when observing strict rules for an action scenario would get in the way of the drama of the scene. A freeform scenario is any scenario that uses some, but not all, rules that are normally a part of an action scenario. There may or may not be any defined actions or even an established turn order. This allows each character the freedom to act as would make sense to the scenario.","title":"Action Scenarios"},{"location":"gameplay/action/#action-scenarios","text":"When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, the timing of when each character can do what is critically important.

While your gamemaster can absolutely decide on how much potential to award on their own (one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is about right), roleplaying is constructing a shared narrative and unplanned progress through a character arc is just as important as advancing the plot. Checklists and Goals A way everybody can help determine how many points of potential to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with \"Gain a point of potential if we...\"-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential. Session goals can be as specific as \"Gain a point of potential if we defeat the Bronzeridge Bandits,\" or as generic as \"Gain a point of potential if everyone had fun.\" You don't have to come up with the perfect session goals the first time around-- session goals can always be changed after each session, and should always be changed if the group isn't feeling them. The goal of session goals is to encourage players to do the things that the group enjoys. The more fun the session, the more potential everybody should get! Here are some end-of-session goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session. At the end of a session: Gain a point of potential if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by Gain a point of potential if we accomplished something new and important Gain a point of potential if we learned something important about the world, or if something important changed Gain a point of potential if we learned something important about a player character, or if something important changed Personal Goals Session goals don't have to be shared-- if your group is comfortable with players having differing amounts of potential, you can play with the idea of having personal goals in addition to the group checklist. You should reduce the number of shared goals if characters have their own personal goals, since you probably want to keep a one-to-one ratio between hours played and goals possible to achieve. Personal goals are set by each player on their own based on whatever makes sense for their character. They can be changed after each session, or whenever the player and gamemaster agree that they should be changed. Personal goals often end up being more specific than shared goals-- especially when you're still feeling out your character --but they should evolve overtime into something generic that reliably cuts to the core of your character. Early goals like these: Gain a point of potential if you protected Wren from the brigands Gain a point of potential if you take a thieves guild job Gain a point of potential if you talk your way into the art show Can become these: Gain a point of potential if you put yourself in harms way to protect another Gain a point of potential if you skimmed a little off the top for yourself Gain a point of potential if you convinced someone to see it your way Potential Potential is a measure of your growth. You'll start with some potential during character creation , and then earn more at the end of every session. You can then spend that potential in game, after the game, and/or out of game -- depending on what your group prefers -- to improve attributes , skills, and legacies , increase your character's health and specific ability points , and/or to gain new abilities . Spending Potential You can spend one point of potential to: Learn or level up a skill or legacy Increase your character's health per injury by 1 You can spend two points of potential to: Increase an attribute by +1, up to the attribute level cap Increase one of your pools of ability points by 1 Create a new pool of ability points You can spend three points of potential to: Learn a new ability Strengthen an existing ability Leveling Up Leveling up means more dice to use on tests and more room to grow your attributes.

Similarly, if your guard got broken, sand got kicked in your eyes, or you're pinned down by sniper fire, other people might have bonus dice against you. Bonus dice are a number of dice of the same size with a name that describes them. Just like with skills and backgrounds , the name of the bonus is how you determine if it makes sense that you can take some dice from it. How do they get created? Bonus dice can be created to represent any situation in which a character either has the upper hand or is vulnerable; especially to represent the hazards or tactical benefits of the environment. In game, the bonus dice are often created by an action that a character might perform-- ducking behind cover, striking someone with a poisoned weapon, or wading into a swamp. In addition, abilities or equipment may put specific bonus dice on things. How do you use them? Bonus dice are what they sound like-- extra dice that you can roll on top of the normal amount you'd roll whenever you roll for a test . You can take dice from a bonus whenever it makes sense that the bonus is working in your favor! There's no limit to the number of bonus dice that you can benefit from, which means you can use bonus dice to do things that otherwise would be impossible. How long do they last? When the last die is taken from a set of bonus dice, it disappears. The character afflicted by the disadvantage imposed on them has either recovered from it or figured out how to deal with it. The tactical advantage acquired is no longer applicable or just doesn't provide the benefits it once did. However, bonus dice should also go away whenever it makes sense that they should-- especially when they have to do with the environment. It doesn't matter how good the cover was, the minute you move out from behind it any benefit it provided you is gone. Examples 2d6 bonus dice called Inspired by Bravery could be used up to twice by those inspired. 4d10 bonus dice called Seeing Shadows could be used up to four times by anyone who wants to use a character's hallucinations against them. 3d8 bonus dice called Cover behind the Parapets could be used up to three times by anyone who could avoid danger behind the stone fortifications. 6d4 bonus dice on a character called Waist Deep in Sewage could be used up to six times by monsters lurking under the water or a sniper taking advantage of the character's slowed movements. Special Bonus Dice All bonus dice can be used as described above, but they can also be customized along the same lines as abilities . Being On Fire is absolutely a disadvantage, but if you wanted to represent the damage of the flames the burning character might need to roll one of the bonus dice, removing it from the pool, and take damage equal to the roll. There are no hard and fast rules on customizing bonus dice, but a good rule of thumb for gamemasters is not to give every set of bonus dice special rules. Aside from the complexity it adds, customizing bonus dice make them feel special-- They give flair to specialized equipment (such as magic items, incendiary devices, or poisons) and powerful character abilities . If you spread that around too much, it'll start to feel like that's how all bonus dice should work.","title":"Bonus Dice"},{"location":"gameplay/bonus_dice/#bonus-dice","text":"If you're fired up, tactically informed, or your teammate put you into a good position, you get access to bonus dice to do awesome stuff.

In addition, abilities or equipment may put specific bonus dice on things.","title":"How do they get created?"},{"location":"gameplay/bonus_dice/#how-do-you-use-them","text":"Bonus dice are what they sound like-- extra dice that you can roll on top of the normal amount you'd roll whenever you roll for a test . You can take dice from a bonus whenever it makes sense that the bonus is working in your favor!

The character afflicted by the disadvantage imposed on them has either recovered from it or figured out how to deal with it. The tactical advantage acquired is no longer applicable or just doesn't provide the benefits it once did. However, bonus dice should also go away whenever it makes sense that they should-- especially when they have to do with the environment.

Being On Fire is absolutely a disadvantage, but if you wanted to represent the damage of the flames the burning character might need to roll one of the bonus dice, removing it from the pool, and take damage equal to the roll. There are no hard and fast rules on customizing bonus dice, but a good rule of thumb for gamemasters is not to give every set of bonus dice special rules. Aside from the complexity it adds, customizing bonus dice make them feel special-- They give flair to specialized equipment (such as magic items, incendiary devices, or poisons) and powerful character abilities . If you spread that around too much, it'll start to feel like that's how all bonus dice should work.","title":"Special Bonus Dice"},{"location":"gameplay/chases/","text":"Chases A necromancer flees as the tide turns against his undead minions, an archeologist braves the ocean to be first to reach an ancient tomb, a spy dashes through the hangar towards their getaway starship fueled for takeoff. Chases are action scenarios best suited for when participants are competing to reach a particular goal . A footrace across the room may be over in a matter of seconds, a car chase across the interstate may take hours, and chasing across countries might even take days. Whatever the scope of the chase, each participant in a chase has a position that is described by their distance from the goal in actions. Teams Characters can form into teams, together acting as one participant in the chase. Teams share their position and can work together to take actions. Tests of ability performed by a team are performed by whichever member of the team makes sense while the other members of the team provide assistance . The downside is that they also share a turn and as a team get three actions. Characters can leave a team at any point in a round before their team takes a turn, entering the action scenario as if they were a new participant, or join a team at any point in around before their character takes a turn. If a team ever just has one participant, that participant must leave the team and enter the action scenario as if they were a new participant. Acting in a Chase When in a chase, there are a few special actions available to its participants: closing to progress towards the goal, performing a stunt to take a risk to get closer faster, creating an obstacle to slow down other participants, and creating a shortcut to speed up other participants. A character can always spend their actions on doing other things, however as always the gamemaster must rule that the action makes sense in the context. Closing A character who uses an action to close decreases their distance to the goal by one action. This represents doing whatever is necessary to get closer to the goal, be it kicking down a door, running across a room, or speeding down the highway. Performing a Stunt A character who uses their action to perform a stunt takes a risk to try to get to the goal faster. Stunts are complicated, so they take at least 2 actions to perform. Based on the stunt described, the player can wager a number of actions as the cost of the stunt-- based on the number of actions it takes and the action described, the gamemaster will then devise a test of ability to determine what is necessary to successfully pull off the stunt. If the character... Fails, the stunt goes wrong in some way. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test. Partially succeeds, their stunt is successful, but not as efficient as it could have been. They move towards the goal with the same number of actions that they spent on the stunt, then move towards the goal by a further action. They also suffer some risk from the test. Fully succeeds, their stunt is fully successful. They move towards the goal a number of actions equal to twice the number of actions they spent on the stunt and will effectively minimize the risk from the test. Critically succeeds, their stunt is wildly successful. They move towards the goal a number of actions equal to twice the number of actions they spent on the stunt, then move 2 further actions towards the goal. Creating an Obstacle or Shortcut A character who uses their actions to create an obstacle or create a shortcut chooses to not move closer to the goal, but rather change the chase for other participants. Just like stunts, creating obstacles and shortcuts are complicated and require at least 2 actions to perform. Based on what makes sense, the gamemaster will determine who in the chase is affected by the obstacle or shortcut. Like performing a stunt, the character wagers a number of actions that this obstacle or shortcut is worth and the gamemaster establishes a test of ability to determine whether the creation of the obstacle or shortcut is successful or not. Creating an Obstacle If the character... Fails, the obstacle could not be created. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test. Partially succeeds, the obstacle was created, but offers only marginal benefit. All affected participants are moved 1 action away from the goal to represent the obstacle's delay and the character suffers some risk from the test. Fully succeeds, the obstacle was created successfully. All affected participants are moved a number of actions away from the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the obstacle. Critically succeeds, the obstacle was particularly effective. All affected participants are moved a number of actions away from the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the obstacle plus 1. Creating a Shortcut If the character... Fails, the shortcut could not be created. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test. Partially succeeds, the shortcut was created, but offers only marginal benefit. All affected participants are moved 1 action towards the goal to represent the time saved by the shortcut and the character suffers some risk from the test. Fully succeeds, the shortcut was created successfully. All affected participants are moved a number of actions towards the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the shortcut. Critically succeeds, the shortcut was created and is particularly effective. All affected participants are moved a number of actions towards the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the shortcut plus 1. Shaking Pursuit Sometimes, a chase will be initiated by pursuit. While usually the pursued character is fleeing to somewhere (in which case, a typical chase towards a goal is appropriate), occasionally the pursued character's goal is simply to shake their pursuers. In this case, the pursued character's position is considered to be the goal of the chase and any actions that the pursued character takes that would move them towards the goal instead move all their pursuers that many actions away.","title":"Chases"},{"location":"gameplay/chases/#chases","text":"A necromancer flees as the tide turns against his undead minions, an archeologist braves the ocean to be first to reach an ancient tomb, a spy dashes through the hangar towards their getaway starship fueled for takeoff.

However, there are some broad scenarios that will come up in every game that deserve their own specific test. Attacking with a Weapon Attacking with a weapon is a test of ability . The attribute for the test can be any of the attributes that the weapon is tagged with, and the difficulty of the test is the armor value of the target. When a character makes a test of any attribute with a goal to attack with a weapon , if they... Fail: Their target takes no damage. Partially succeed: Their target takes damage equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down. Fully succeed: Their target takes damage equal the attacker's total for the test. Critically Succeed: Their target takes damage equal to double the attacker's total for the test. As an example, here's the test for attacking an armor value 15 target using a greatsword with the tags brawn , melee , large , cleaving , and slashing : Attacking with a Greatsword Difficulty 15 Test of Brawn Goal: Striking the target and inflicting injury Risk: Not inflicting any damage On a failure: the target takes no damage. On a partial success: the target takes damage equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down. On a full success: the target takes damage equal the attacker's total for the test. On a critical success: the target takes damage equal to double the attacker's total for the test. Improvised Weapons Sometimes, it makes sense that a character can attack with an object not intended to be a weapon or with a weapon in a way that it's not intended to be used. Examples of this could be using a table leg as a cudgel, throwing a maul, or bashing with the butt of a sniper rifle. Attacking in this way technically may violate the range or attributes tagged on the weapon, but should always be possible. Your gamemaster may rule that a character can use this weapon or object to attack with whatever attribute makes sense for the situation but using it in this way carries an additional risk of being damaged, destroyed, or otherwise lost in test of ability associated with the attack. In addition, the gamemaster may say that some tags on the weapon do not apply -- bashing with the butt of a rifle, for instance, would likely not benefit from the rifle's quality tag, since the quality likely refers to its utility as a ranged weapon, not as a cudgel. As an example, here's a possible test for attacking an armor value 15 target using the butt of a sniper rifle with the tags agility , long-range , large , and precision : Attacking with the Butt of a Sniper Rifle Difficulty 15 Test of Brawn Goal: Striking the target and inflicting injury Risk: Not inflicting any damage, breaking or damaging the Sniper Rifle On a failure: the target takes no damage and the sniper rifle gets bent or broken in the scuffle and requires repairs. On a partial success: the target takes damage equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down, and the sniper rifle jams or is otherwise unusable for a short time. On a success: the target takes damage equal the attacker's total for the test. On a critical success: the target takes damage equal to double the attacker's total for the test. Gathering Information Sometimes the goal of a test is to find answers to questions . Such a goal might be researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual. In this case, the results of measure success in number of questions answered. The gamemaster may provide questions that are available to be asked, or allow any question to be asked. When a character makes a test of any attribute to find answers to questions , if they... Fail: They get unreliable information-- they may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely. Partially succeed: They learn some information-- they may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully. Succeed: They learn a good amount of information-- they may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully. Critically Succeed: They learn a significant amount of information-- they may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully. The answers to the questions should make sense contextually and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question \"Who killed this person?\" with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with \"someone with red hair and a blue cloak\" based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby. Questions should never feel wasted. If the answer to a question was plain or common knowledge and would not normally require a test to uncover, it should be answered without counting against the number of questions that the tested character can ask. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, the person asked the question should indicate why it is not answerable and it will not count against the number of questions that the character can ask. Players, if your gamemaster allows you to ask any question but you're not sure what to ask, \"What questions should I ask?\" can be a solid question to ask, since learning the right questions to ask is a crucial step in information gathering. Gamemasters, if this is a question that is somehow unanswerable, make sure you have an answer as to why and how it can become answerable. Making Progress on a Complicated Goal Sometimes the goal of a test is to make progress on a larger goal that can't be resolved by just one test. Such goal might be making something complicated, taking out an enemy, or working as a crew to steer a ship through obstacles. The GM will create a progress meter for the overarching goal of the tests the players-- a total number to reach in order to accomplish the overall goal. Any tests that help accomplish the overall goal can help fill the meter. You can represent this meter just by a total number to hit, or you can draw it on a piece of paper to help illustrate the overall progress, whatever works best for your group. When a character makes a test of any attribute with a goal to fill a progress meter , if they... Fail: They instead make things more complicated, either by falling victim to an existing risk or introducing a new one. Partially succeed: They are able to make some progress. Fill the progress meter by half of what they rolled. Fully succeed: They make great progress. Fill the progress meter by what they rolled. Critically Succeed: They make incredible progress. Fill the progress meter by twice what they rolled. Preparing for Action While it can be rewarding to act out the players gathering information before going on a heist or gearing up before setting out on adventure, sometimes it's more fun to roll for preparation and cut to the chase. When you roll for preparation, how well you succeed awards you with a number of flashbacks . Flashbacks do exactly what it sounds like they do-- when the GM describes a complication that your preparation could have resolved, you can use a flashback to take the narrative back in time to describe how your preparation dealt with that problem. An adventuring party in Victorian London is investigating an elusive murderer. In an effort to capture them, the group takes a few days to take in the crime scene and prepare. Later, the group finds themselves deep in the sewers chasing after their quarry. In an effort to catch up to them, the mastermind of the group flashes back to purchasing a sewer map from a descendant of one of the original architects. The player marks off the cost of the map and uses it to corner the suspect and force a confrontation. Not every preparation is guaranteed to succeed, however. The GM is well within their rights to ask you to make a test of ability to see how well your preparation holds up, or even if things go well for you. An adventuring party plans to steal from a high security vault. They take a few days to case the joint. Later, the group is deep within the compound when they discover an impenetrable web of security lasers. The hacker flashes back to making preparations to temporarily disable the security. The GM asks them to roll to see if they're able to bypass the vault's security-- and for how long. The hacker manages a partial success-- long enough to get them in to grab what they needed, but not long enough to keep them from tripping the lasers on their way back out the door! When a character takes some downtime and makes a test of any attribute with a goal to prepare for a situation , if they... Fail: They get two flashbacks, but one of them is guaranteed to go wrong. Partially succeed: They get two flashbacks. Fully succeed: They get three flashbacks. Critically Succeed: They get four flashbacks No Rewriting History It's important to note that flashbacks should not rewrite history. If a guard sounded the alarm, no amount of flashing back to bribing them will undo that the alarm has been pressed. However, if the GM describes the alarm being pressed but hasn't yet described the flashing lights, it's totally valid for someone with tech savviness to cut in with a flashback to disabling the alarm system before the party made their way in.","title":"Standard Tests of Ability"},{"location":"gameplay/common_tests/#standard-tests-of-ability","text":"For the most part, tests of ability are intended to be created to fit the situation.

When you have more than four hours of downtime available to you, ask your gamemaster how many downtime activities you can perform over the time you have. Crafting You can spend your downtime to create or modify items! While it's not always necessary, it's probably a good idea to collaborate with your gamemaster to collaborate to create crafting \"recipes\" of material requirements and a written out Test of Ability with a goal of making progress towards creating or modifying a specific item. Writing it up makes it easy for you to get consistent results from spending your downtime making stuff. These recipes can also have any particular tools or environments that are required for your creative endeavor.

While it's not always necessary, it's probably a good idea to collaborate with your gamemaster to collaborate to create crafting \"recipes\" of material requirements and a written out Test of Ability with a goal of making progress towards creating or modifying a specific item. Writing it up makes it easy for you to get consistent results from spending your downtime making stuff. These recipes can also have any particular tools or environments that are required for your creative endeavor. Here's an example recipe for a sleep poison: Sleep Poison A living creature that is wounded by a weapon coated in a dose of this poison must make a difficulty 20 test of Brawn or be poisoned for 1 hour.

A test of ability (or test for short) is resolved by rolling skill, legacy, and background dice and adding the value of an attribute to meet or exceed a number that represents the difficulty of doing what they want to do. While most tests emerge fluidly from gameplay and don't require this level of detail, a fully written test would look something like this: Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant Difficulty 15 Test of Presence Goal: Turning a profit on contraband Risk: The merchant might be insulted or involve the authorities If they... Fail: the merchant gets indignant and starts making a scene. The authorities are sure to get involved immediately. Partially succeed: the merchant agrees to buy the contraband, but it seems like they're not likely to want to see you again. They may tip off the authorities, but not until after you've left. Fully succeed: you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal Critically succeed: not only does the merchant accept the deal but they happen to be a known fence in the area and look forward to working with you again Establishing Difficulty Most of the time, the difficulty is a static number determined by the gamemaster based on the skill required to achieve success with minimal risk. Below are a collection of difficulty rules of thumb. When creating a test, it's a good idea to start with a difficulty based on one of the rules of thumb and increase or decrease it by a few points depending on how easy or difficult the test is meant to be. Talented but inexperienced level 1 characters can handle tests of difficulty 0 Experienced level 2 characters can handle tests of difficulty 10 Professionals who are at least level 3 can handle tests of difficulty 20 Experts who are at least level 4 can handle tests of difficulty 30 Masters who are at least level 5 can handle tests of difficulty 40 Only Legendary characters of level 6 and up can attempt to handle tests of difficulty 50 or higher Players, the difficulty rules of thumb can also help you gauge your character's proficiency. If you're regularly rolling above a 20 on a test, chances are you are on the same level as someone who performs those sorts of tests for a living. Gamemasters, if you choose to take characters higher than level 6 you should consider writing your own rules of thumb not only to help yourself consistently apply difficulties across your world, but also to help your players understand what rolling a 10 means when compared to the rest of your world's citizens. Competitions When characters directly compete with each other, the gamemaster may rule that it is appropriate to resolve the test by comparing each competing character's roll against each other instead of against a static difficulty. In these competitions , the rolls of the other competing characters are considered the difficulty of the test. Resolving Tests In most cases the gamemaster will determine what attribute(s) are applicable for the skill check in question and the player will offer up suggestions of skills and/or backgrounds that they have on their character sheet to add the dice associated with those skills and/or backgrounds. A character can contribute one skill or background die to a test of ability up to a maximum equal to their level . After that, a character can take dice from any relevant bonus dice and add them to their roll. Assisting Before the dice are rolled, any character who can reasonably use one of their skills or backgrounds to help the character performing the test may offer their assistance by choosing the appropriate die and rolling it with the character attempting the test. The character attempting the test may then choose a number of dice less than or equal to their level to use for the test. All characters who assist in the test help the tested character reach their goal, making success more likely, but each character who assists in the test also either introduce a new risk to the test or somehow worsen the existing risk, making failure all the more dangerous. If the initial risk was a deadly pitfall, the assisting character could be at risk of falling in as well. If the initial risk was taking too long to researching an antidote before the poison took hold, the additional minds involved might result in a fatal miscommunication. Determining the Outcome Once the attribute, backgrounds, and skills are all chosen, the dice are rolled and the gamemaster compares the total result to the difficulty of the test and describes what happens. If a character's roll meets or exceeds the difficulty of the test, they have succeeded and are able to do what they set out to do. If a character's roll does not meet the difficulty of the test, they have failed and things are about to get bad for them. While success does mean that the character has accomplished what they wanted to, how well they have succeeded determines how much any risks involved affect them. If a character rolls 20 or more over the difficulty of a test, they have critically succeeded ; not only did they do what they set out to do and minimize any associated risks, they also get something extra that they wanted or suffer no risks at all! If a character rolls 10 or more over the difficulty of a test, they have fully succeeded ; they did what they set out to do and minimize any associated risks. If a character only meets or exceeds the difficulty of a test, they have partially succeeded ; they did what they set out to do but they're going to take the brunt of the risks involved. If a character does not meet the difficulty of the test, they have failed -- they don't do what they set out to do and they are either going to suffer the worst possible case of the risks involved or introduce a new risk. Determining the Outcome of a Competition Determining the outcome of a competition in which there are two participants is done the same way as determining the outcome in a test with a static difficulty. When more than one character is involved, characters are instead often ranked from highest to lowest , based on their roll. The gamemaster can then use these positions to describe the result of the competition based on the relative placement of the competitors. Competition Tiebreakers Sometimes, characters in a competition might tie. In cases where the gamemaster needs these ties to be broken, other aspects of the tied characters come into question. A tie can be broken by comparing the passive scores the respective attributes that the characters used for the test. If there is still a tie, that tie is resolved at the gamemaster's discretion, perhaps taking into consideration number of relevant skills/backgrounds or sources of narrative truth. Example of a Test Let's bring it all together and walk through a test of ability using the Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant example above: A thief character attempts to turn a profit on some contraband . Since this is an action that carries the risk of the merchant becoming upset or involving the authorities and some uncertainty between which of the goal and the risk will occur, the gamemaster calls for a test of ability. Given the social nature of the action, the gamemaster says that convincing the merchant is going to be a test of Presence and secretly marks down a difficulty of 15 , since they rule that this requires professional expertise. On the thief's character sheet are the backgrounds Smuggler and Mercenary , as well as the skills, Acrobatics , Lockpicking , and Intimidation . Based on their current goal, they choose their background Smuggler , and their skill Intimidation as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation. The gamemaster agrees that these are good choices, so the thief rolls their 1d10 Presence, 1d6 Intimidation, and 1d12 for their Smuggler background. They roll a 10, a 5, and a 5 for a total of 20-- a spectacular roll. They have a +5 attribute modifier to their Presence, bringing the total of the roll up to 25. The difficulty of the test was 15 , and 25 is 10 higher than the difficulty, which makes it a full success . which means you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal . Based on the skills used, the gamemaster now has everything they need to paint a picture of how the sweating merchant responds to the smuggler's intimidation and ultimately gives in. Good Tests A test of ability is fundamentally useless without a goal , a risk , and an uncertainty . Without uncertainty, the narrative already clearly indicates what will happen, so it should just happen. Without a goal, the roller's agency is subverted-- if they don't know what they're trying to do, the number rolled doesn't mean anything to them. Without a risk, failure has no cost and the test is drained of tension. At best, it's boring-- at worst it's frustrating. This is not to say that tests need always be dramatic or life-changing-- changing the lettering of a sign to prank a party member is as valid a goal as crossing a precarious bridge. Getting caught in the middle of defacing a street sign is still a risk, it's just a less obvious one than tumbling off of that precarious bridge. The concept of goals and risks is something that relies on the players being immersed in their character, their surroundings, and the world at large. If you're playing with a bunch of people new to the system, take some time in an introductory dungeon to help your players think in terms of the goals they want to perform and the risks that might come with them. Goal Guidelines Goals are a statement of intent and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. Gamemasters, this is the part of skill checks that fall on the players to define. You should be prepared to ask questions until you are absolutely certain of the intention of the player's actions. If a player doesn't know what they are trying to do in the situation, the gamemaster should present some options like you might find in a choose-your-own-adventure novel. Risk Guidelines Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as taking a chainsaw to the chest, and should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night or missing a crucial detail.","title":"Tests of Ability"},{"location":"gameplay/tests/#tests-of-ability","text":"Whenever a character attempts to do something with a goal in mind, a risk present, and an uncertainty of whether either or both will happen, the gamemaster will call for a test of ability to determine what happens next.

Dice Size In Simply Roleplaying, the four sided die (1d4), six sided die (1d6), eight sided die (1d8), ten sided die (1d10), and twelve sided die (1d12) are the most commonly used dice. Usually, you progress from 1d4 to 1d6 to 1d8 and so on. For this reason, Simply Roleplaying uses a tabletop roleplaying concept where the dice are described by size -- the more sides the die has, the \"bigger\" it's considered to be. Generally, dice size is used to compare dice. A d10 is bigger than a d8 and a d4 is smaller than a d6. Sometimes in Simply Roleplaying a rule will refer to \"the next biggest\" or \"the next smallest\" size of a die. In that case, just remember that unless the rule says otherwise, dice can only be 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, or 1d12-- there is no die bigger than 1d12 or smaller than 1d4. Movement Unlike other popular roleplaying games, Simply Roleplaying does not define strict rules for how many feet a character can move in a handful of seconds. Instead, Simply Roleplaying defines distances in \"spaces,\" which could be a 70px square on your favorite Virtual TableTop, one-inch hex on your dining room table, inches on a measuring tape, or whatever else you want to use to represent spaces. The important thing is that they're all a relative gauge of distance to each other. Feel free to come up with your own measurement for how big a space is in the game -- popular fantasy roleplaying games suggest that a space is usually about 5 ft / 1.5 m. Narrative Truth Sometimes the rules of Simply Roleplaying will say that something happens \"when it makes sense.\" This is a simple way of saying \"when the story we're telling together says it should happen.\" Certainly a character would heal from their wounds after some downtime recovering, but they might also heal from a healing spring that cures all wounds. Generally what \"makes sense\" is obvious. When it's not obvious, what makes sense should be a conversation between players and the gamemaster.","title":"Some basics"},{"location":"getting_started/#some-basics","text":"Before you dive straight into Simply Roleplaying, there are a few common mechanics in the system to understand.","title":"Some basics"},{"location":"getting_started/#dice-size","text":"In Simply Roleplaying, the four sided die (1d4), six sided die (1d6), eight sided die (1d8), ten sided die (1d10), and twelve sided die (1d12) are the most commonly used dice.

That said, gamemasters, you should read this as well-- it might even be good to read it aloud to your players at the table. Creating a character is all about dreaming up a concept, then figuring out how to realize it mechanically. There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character. If you're new to roleplaying games in general, you may want to start by writing an answer to each of the headings before you read the text under them. What comes naturally to you? Your starting speed is 6 spaces . This is how many spaces you can move with an action . In addition, all characters have intrinsic attributes about them that make it easier or harder for them to do specific things. Read up on attributes , then adjust your attributes until they all add up to +12 . Make sure to adhere to the attribute level cap ! Gamemasters, if players are starting at a level higher than 1 their starting attributes should add up to 12 times their starting level. How much stress can you handle? Once you've done that, it's time to calculate the maximum amount of damage your character can sustain. Read up on health, damage, and injuries , then calculate your health per injury by adding your Will and Brawn to 12. Health = 12 + Brawn + Will What is your story? Think about where in the campaign world you come from, and why you are seeking out to adventure with your fellow players. Then, read up on skills and backgrounds , then choose to either make a background or start brimming with potential . If you chose to make a background , write a background that summarizes your character's story so far. If you chose to start brimming with potential , your gamemaster will allot you with a starting pool of 15 points of potential to spend on skills as you progress. Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish, just make sure you always offer 15 points of potential per background should a player opt to not make a background. What do you have with you? Think about what possessions your character might have and write them down. This doesn't have to be an exhaustive list, but it should probably cover most things that you'd use to showcase what cool stuff your character can do. From bedrolls to mp3 players, what a character might carry with them in their day-to-day speaks a lot to who they are and where they come from. Consider writing down a sentimental object such as a an old, handwritten journal or a locket carrying an irreplaceable lock of grey hair. Once you've finished figuring out what you've got, read up on equipment and add equipment tags to anything that would benefit from having them. Be sure to talk to your gamemaster about the equipment and tags you've chosen. If your campaign is going to be combat focused, it's probably a good idea to have something with the Weapon tag and something with the Armor tag. Examples A cavern explorer might have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, and a grappling hook (close-range).

There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character.

They're all forms of extranormal powers . Here's a way you can achieve powers in Simply Roleplaying using appropriately named Skills/Backgrounds, Abilities, and Equipment. What can Powers Do? By their very nature, powers almost always allow their wielder to do things that would otherwise be impossible. Creating flame from nothing, communicating over vast distances, or teleportation are all things that are typically accomplishable with the right powers. How do Powers Work? Powers, just like anything else significant that a character does, often require a test of ability to use. The skills and backgrounds required to wield them tend to describe the power; a pyromancy skill allows the wielder to manipulate fire, a telepathy skill allows them to speak into the minds of others, and a gravitational manipulation skill allows them manipulate gravity. That said, just having the pyromancy skill doesn't necessarily give you control over flame. Usually you'll need an ability, a piece of equipment, or some combination of both to do that. Powers and Abilities Powers are extraordinary and unique things that a character can do. If this sounds a lot like an ability, you're right! The root of almost every power is an Ability that allows you to do something narratively extraordinary . Specifically, it's often a good idea to have a base level ability that gives you some sway over your power. Take this Ability, for instance: Pyromancer When you have equipment tagged with Focus and Pyromancy , you can conjure and control flame through the pyromancy skill. Your GM may ask you to spend ability points on particularly large or complicated effects. Characters without that ability could still learn and use the pyromancy skill to represent their knowledge of how pyromancy works or its history, but only those with that ability could use it to literally move fire. In addition, you'll often want to create abilities for some of the extraordinary things you can do with your powers. Pyromancer will let you perform tests of abilities to control flames, but creating an explosion or summoning a fire elemental are likely the domain of a supplementary ability! Powers and Equipment Equipment with the tag focus and tagged with one or more extranormal powers will either allow the wielder to use that particular power or enhance their control over the power. It might strengthen the power, reduce the requirements for using the power at all, or mitigate the usual risks that the power has. Focuses take many shapes. Magicians might have wands, cauldrons, or spellbooks. Superheroes might have rings, hammers, or gadgets. Psionics might have emitters, inhibitors, or focusing helmets. Focuses also have an attribute tag to determine which attribute you use to exert your power. Usually this is a mental attribute; Intuition focuses might be used for powers dealing with the slippery minds of others, Knowledge focuses might be used for powers that require intense study like harnessing the mathematical formulas required to manifest elemental forces, and Will focuses might be used for manifesting power drawn from a covenant or divinity. Naming Powers and their Skills Unless your setting encourages particularly broad skills, your gamemaster may want you to avoid more ambiguously named skills like magic or super-powers and instead focus on specifics. A good rule of thumb is to think of a particular thing to have power over and use that as the description of the skill. Your gamemaster should be able to help you figure out what a good skill would be to represent the power you want in their setting. Further Limiting Powers Without powers, skills and backgrounds tend to be limited by what we can suspend our disbelief that the character we're playing can do. For instance; no matter how stealthy you are, you still can't hide in broad daylight. It's much easier to suspend our disbelief with made-up powers, so they can easily become the most useful thing in a campaign! If you find that powers are taking over your game, or if you want a particular power to be more difficult to harness, consider making the power(s) in question dangerous. Dangerous Powers Dangerous powers carry greater risks than doing something without them. The power may have chance of going wrong or be strenuous to use, meaning the very act of using those powers in a test may have their own negative consequences. For powers with risks, the scale of what the power is being used to do usually increases the scale of the risk. Levitating a pebble might take a moment of concentration where levitating a boulder would be exhausting and levitating a mountain might take so much out of you it could kill you if you tried. Here's an example of implementing a risk of exhaustion into a strenuous use of power: Growing a Tree with Nature Magic Difficulty 30 Test of Knowledge Goal: Growing a tree from a sapling to a fully grown oak Risk: Expediting life takes its toll, exhausting you If they... Fail: the tree may grow, but it takes far more energy than you expected. Take 30 damage from the toll of your magic. Partially succeed: the tree grows, but it drains your energy to do so. Take 15 damage from the toll of your magic. Fully succeed: you coax life to grow faster than it normally would, growing the sapling to a mighty oak. Take 5 damage from the toll of your magic. Critically succeed: the tree grows at your will without costing you anything at all Example Powers Some powers that a character might use their Knowledge for are: Pyromancy , from lighting torches to raging bonfire Telekinesis , moving stuff with your mind Metal bending , iron, steel, brass and lead all bend for you like clay Magnetism manipulation , how does it work? Some powers that a character might use their Intuition for are: Fear manipulation , the amount of times one picks flight over fight Telepathy , the ability to convey thoughts into the minds of others Scrying , the ability to see distant people and places Mind reading , the ability to pluck thoughts from the minds of others Some covenants and divinities that a character might use their Will to manifest miracles from are: Magnusancte , whose brilliant magic judges both the target and the wielder Bloodfrost , the art of the Thorns of the Red Ringed Rose that can only be conjured by inflicting suffering upon oneself Floras , the anima of a grove of trees with healing fruits Pureum , the Hexadivinite lady of the purple robe, whose chaotic nature can be used to dispel magic","title":"Powers"},{"location":"setting_rules/powers/#powers","text":"Magic is a common tool in high fantasy, superhero fiction, and science fiction-- it goes by different names depending on your exact setting, but the rules presented here should work for anything from magic spells to super powers to psionics.

The story goes that there were but a handful of families of humans and each was offered a gift by the elements that made up the world. What they received transformed the entire family into something new and great, and they went forth and spread across Pangea. The final family asked for nothing, but worried that the families who had so changed would forget about their shared roots. The elements offered them a gift not simply for them, but for all of the humans-- the gift of a magically shared language. No matter how different the humans became, they would always be able to understand one another. Gradually, these variations on humanity earned names for themselves to represent the gift that so shaped their lives. When children are born from parents of different gifts, they may take on one, the other, or a unique mixture of both gifts. As a result, there's no telling whether this is a complete list of the original gifts that were given-- there may yet be more varieties of humans out there with new and strange gifts. This page is currently under construction and may contain inaccurate references to old material. Dwarves These short, gray-skinned humanoids spend most of their lives underground, building huge underground cities and basing their economy around whatever they can mine. They are solitary pangeans that prefers to spend time among itself and have a deep reverence for stone and dirt. Dwarves have perfected the ability that they call \"life forging\", a combination of blacksmithing and magic that allows a group of dwarves gathered together to, when they perform the correct rites, take the soul of a near-dead dwarf and bind it into an object, creating a magical artifact that the near-dead dwarf can live in. Due to the near holy reverence that Dwarves give to stone, nearly all objects created this way are hewn from a single piece of stone. Depending on the rites performed the object can perform any variety of actions, but is typically limited to telepathically aiding and communicating with the person that is wielding the weapon. Elves The idea of a beautiful creature so aligned with nature that it might have been there from the beginning almost spells 'Elf' in its description. Pangeans generally classified by their tall, slender appearance, and their uniquely shaped ears, the unique Elven facial structure is frequently quoted as being 'eerily beautiful.' Elves naturally grow to anywhere between 1.68-1.93 meters tall, and are frequently considered underweight for their height. Elves always have a particularly fair complexion, and have the natural array of human hair colors. Their facial structure is particularly angular, and they almost exclusively have almond-shaped eyes and tapered ears. Their distinctive and aesthetically pleasing appearances belie the natural Elven inclination to be obsessed with beauty. Most Elves are so wrapped up in appearing fair that they will surpress the urge to display emotions at the risk of marring their beauty. Many Elves have become so focused on it that they tend to be prejudiced against individuals who they don't consider to be 'beautiful'. This often leads Elves to be exceptionally selective with breeding and are not inclined to accept Half-Elves (those Elves sired in part by another pangean) into their midst due to their percieved impurity. This obsession with beauty also drives many Elves to experiment with modifying the world and its denizens with magic. If the world were to recognize them for what they were, it would be stunned by how frequently Elves were the culprit of it's favorite mythical creatures. The Elves are known for being reclusive, hiding themselves away in clusters of hidden cities referred to as the 'Elven Lands'. The Elves operate on a meritocracy, a government of officials selected on the basis of their individual ability. As such, it's not uncommon for Elven cities to feature prominently displayed Thieves guilds since they reason that if someone was stolen from, they could not protect the stolen property adequately and therefore didn't deserve to own it in the first place. Elven culture is firmly rooted in nature. Everything from their city names to their drinks tend to have names pertaining to trees or various plants or trees. Some of the largest Elven cities have a resident pair 'Grovemothers' or 'Grovefathers' who serve as the head of the community and commune with the surrounding trees and nature. The Elven lands are also filled with mysticism, with numerous areas reserved for 'Trials' or 'Rituals'. Religiously, most Elves tend to be Hexadivinites. Faeries Apart from the slight hue change in their skin tone, Faeries appear in nearly every way identical to elves, but still somehow fall short of the beauty of the elves when compared. However, unlike Elves, the Faeries are heavily aligned with magical elements. Each Faerie has an alternate form that they can switch to, comprised of the element they are aligned to. While in this state, the Faerie is unable to communicate with anything not made up of that element and cannot access any of the items they had previously on them, before they transformed. They are still normally susceptible to nonmagical attacks, but can remove wounds from themselves by absorbing nearby objects and elements of their elemental alignment, such as a campfire for fire, rocks for earth, and ice for water. Additionally, while in their elemental state, the Faeries' innate magic potential is doubled. Fae Fae are the light aligned, yellow hued Faeries, and are the most organized of the Faeries. The Fae settle in large groups around anywhere with lots of reflective materials and in warm climates, as close to the sun as they can get. There are very few Fae cities, but those that do exist are large and ancient, covered in elaborate carvings and beautiful architecture. Fae who wander outside of their cities yearn for the comfort of being within those walls, and often will be searching for a way to take residence in the nearest one. Gnomes Gnomes are the earth aligned, orange hued Faeries, and are the strongest, most independent of the Faeries. Gnomes generally do not settle together, but rather go their separate ways to seek their fortune in the world. They rarely journey across the sea, however, because they cannot stand not having solid ground under their feet. When Gnomes do settle together, they create elaborate underground cities that grow in size and complexity as more Gnomes settle in the city. Nymphs Nymphs are the water aligned, blue hued Faeries, and are the most intelligent of the Faeries. Nymphs form small tribes near bodies of water and prize knowledge more than everything else. The love of knowledge is an incessant call, so Nymph are constantly nomadically traveling from place to place to learn what they can learn. Nymph's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair typically silky white or grey. Nymph tribes often cross each other's paths and trade goods and knowledge from which both tribes benefit, and Nymph caravans will often visit other pangeans in caravans to speak with them. Salamanders Salamanders are the fire aligned, red hued Faeries, and are the most charismatic of the Faeries. Much like Nymphs, Salamanders nomadically travel in caravans and only settle temporarily in places. Salamanders are arguably the most nomadic Faeries, simply because they travel for the sole purpose of conversing with other pangeans and having new experiences. Salamander's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair is typically silky black or grey. It is not unheard of for Salamanders to split away from their caravans and find a new life in a city their caravan visits, should they find the place particularly enthralling. Sylphs Sylphs are the wind aligned, green hued Faeries, and are the quickest of the Faeries. Sylphs are often known to be carefree and whimsical, a product of that sort of behavior being encouraged in their culture. Sylphs believe that physical swiftness or mental acuity are the best possible trait for any to cultivate. Due to this love of adaptability, Sylphs are nomadic like Nymphs and Salamanders. It is not uncommon for Sylph tribes to consist of a single family living in strange and harsh locations. Gauntians Gauntian pangeans have an innate magical ability born from closeness to a specific type of animal; the ability to shift into an animal form. Each Gauntian has its own unique limitations to their transformation that governs what they can become, but generally they can transform at any time over the space of one round (no other actions may be made when transforming). Transforming is dangerous, too. Gauntians that stay in their animal form for too long are stuck in that form and cannot get out of it. Trapped Gauntians will slowly lose their sentience until they relapse into the mindset of a wild animal. Aerogaunts Aerogaunts are a tribal society who can transform into birds. An aerogaunt can only become one kind of bird, and will display physical characteristics relating to that bird. Common physical characteristics are patches of feathers on their body around their neck and head, often blending with the hair on their head. Anomalies that can transform into multiple birds do exist, though they are rare. Talk to your GM if you want your character to be one of these anomalies. Aerogaunts typically gather together and form tribes, much like their bird forms would flock together. Most Aerogaunts can transform into a regularly sized bird, and cannot stay in their animal form for more than 24 hours or be trapped. These Aerogaunts retain their normal stats while transformed, but cannot transform into anything larger than 1.5m tall. There are, however, Aerogaunts that can transform into larger birds and larger forms of birds. These Aerogaunts are known as Dires, and transform into birds whose height tends to maintain their pangean height, regardless of the size of the original bird. Aquagaunts Aquagaunts are a Gauntian that can transform into sea animals. They are similarly limited to Solumgaunts in size. More will be added here in the future. Solumgaunts Solumgaunts are essentially the same thing as Aerogaunts, but with a few differences; they too are a tribal society who can transform, but they can transform into land animals. Like Aerogaunts, Solumgaunts can only become one kind of animal and display features relating to that animal; usually patches of fur or scales along their neck, a tail, and the ears of the animal that they transform into. Anomalies that can become more than one kind of animal do exist, albiet as a rarity. Talk to your GM if you want your character to be one of these anomalies. Solumgaunts typically gather and form tribes much like their animal forms would. Most Solumgaunts can transform into a regularly sized land creature, and cannot stay in their animal form for more than 24 hours or else they'd be trapped. These Solumgaunts retain their normal stats while transformed, but cannot transform into anything larger than a lion. There are, however, Solumgaunts who can transform into larger animals and larger forms of animals. These Solumgaunts are known as Dires, and can transform into animals whose forms nearly double in length to their pangean form's normal height. Nexagaunts Nexagaunts have developed the ability to transform into a hybrid between their animal and human state, rather than a full animal state. These hybrid states tend to be about a foot larger than the Nexagaunt's pangean form. Sasquatch The 2 meter tall Sasquatch are fairly easy to distinguish from other forms of Giants because of the thick layer of brown, white, or black fur that covers their body. Most Sasquatch view clothing as \"unnecessary fur\", so seeing a Sasquatch with even rudimentary clothing is a rarity. Sasquatch tend to dwell in hutted tribes or in caves, often traveling in groups of less than a dozen. Ogres If bad feelings are felt towards Sasquatch, far worse feelings are felt towards their slightly taller (usually around 225 cm tall) cousins, Ogres. Ogres are generally considered to be more human due to the fact that they are not covered with fur and are typically wearing clothing, but considered far less human due to their tendency to be cannibalistic. Ogres believe that in order to grow stronger, one must devour the flesh of their opponent directly after defeating the opponent. Trolls Trolls are huge. That's pretty much the first reaction everyone has when encountering them. Among Ogres and Sasquatch, Trolls look the least like other pangeans, with an appearance like a giant hairless sloth. Most Trolls are stocky to withstand the harsh, cold tundras that they're often found in, and stand an impressive 2.5m tall. Humans Averaging just under 2 meters tall, humans represent what is common between all pangeans. The term humanoid is often used interchangeably with pangean, and humans often have a way of using the common tongue in ways that other pangeans cannot. Mer Mer are similar to most pangeans in size with gills positioned behind their ears and under their jaw. Additionally, Mer have a thin and extremely durable sheath of scales that can be used to bind their legs together into a seamless tail for quick swimming underwater, not unlike that of a fish. Deep Ones Deep Ones are ancient beings of the water that dwell on the ocean floor. Their bones are thinly coated in muscle, and chunks of seaweed and coral is often stuck to their limp, slick green skin. They are amphibious, and have much love of water and the creatures that reside therein. Unfortunately, Deep Ones have difficulty communicating with other pangeans, as they never developed a mouth. As a result, they communicate telepathically and have an innate affinity with magic. They have both lungs and gills, and can use either at will. Regardless of this fact, they must remain hydrated in the same way that vampires must feast on blood, so they tend to prefer the comforting wetness of the briny deep. Goblins Short, a bit spindly, with large hooked noses Goblins tend to have pale skin with a hint of green instead of the typical red flush to their skintone. Most stand around 1.5 meters tall and are notoriously spontaneous. Their culture will often create sprawling camps that have multiple layers of walls, simply because they created the first camp with exactly enough space for everyone and dealt with the subsequent population booms with an equal amount of foresight. They do not build things to last and are known to periodically move to a new home because they were bored of their previous one. Orcs Pale skin with an ever so slightly green tint to it, wild black hair, and heavily muscled bodies are some of the first impressions that most have when encountering Orcs. As tenacious as they are intimidating, Orcs tend to be courageous and can endure even the most painful of hardships, sometimes even as well as fiends. Orcs are among the most honest people that anyone may encounter, something which comes as both a blessing and a curse, as they can easily enrage other pangeans whose diplomatic relations requires more \"tact.\" They form tribes of reasonable sizes and prefer to create their camps out of proof of their strength, such as hide huts from hunting and such. There are many Orc cities made out of stone, but most Orcs settle in tribal encampments. Djinn Djinn are pangeans whose gift transforms their entire body into a swirling mass of energy. They are similar to revenants, but far more stable as they were transformed by their gift. Fiends Fiends are a proud, towering, obsidian-skinned pangean with antler-like horns sprouting from their brow. In their own language, there is no word for a distinction between the different pangeans, merely a difference in strength. In their own tongue, they are \"strong ones\" -- an appropriate name when one considers their naturally developing muscles and over 2 meter average height. A fierce, proud pangean, the Fiends are the founders of the Kol'lukt religion, and most Fiends are practitioners of that religion. Changeling Changelings were the exact same as Fiends at one time, but disliked their heavily muscled form-- preferring instead the beauty of the other pangeans. Their desire to mimic the other pangeans prompted magical interference with their own genetic makeup, eventually allowing them to shift their physical features at will into seamless replicas of others (This does not change the Changeling's stats). Changelings are genderless, and often change their gender and racial appearance at will. Revenants Revenants are often referred to as being \"undead\", but such a term is a broadly incorrect categorization of what revenants truly are. Revenants are magic users who have had their lifespan extended by the binding of their soul to organic material through magical bonds, somewhat similar to the Dwarven method of \"life forging\". When a creature is born, their soul is tethered to their body by a cord of life energy; when they die, that cord breaks. Revenants are created by gluing the cord back on with magic, albiet crudely. The most pressing concern with being a Revenant is that their skin and bones cease growing and only deteriorate, requiring them to constantly graft new parts onto themselves. While newly created Revenants look pretty much exactly how they did when they died, older ones have been known to look more than a little bit creepy, with parts grafted where they do not naturally appear. Because they are created with a magical tether, revenants can be killed with a forcible enough disenchantment. Vampires Vampires are a broad class of pangean that are most commonly associated with bats. It is unknown from whence their origin comes, but it is speculated that High Vampires spread the disease among some kind of bat-like animal that, over the generations, became more pangean, resulting in the birth of the first Hellpire. The theory further states that Cave Vampires came from the crossbreeding of the Hellpires and other pangeans. Cave Vampires Cave Vampires live in the crypts of large, usually abandoned structures. Cave Vampires are most commonly recognized by their sunken eyes, bat-like wings that sprout out of their backs, and their deceptively bony muscular build. Hellpires Hellpires are possibly the most feared form of Vampire. Living almost exclusively in caves, Hellpires are much like High Vampires in that they usually appear as a regular humanoid. However, this is not because of a mastery of changing themselves, but rather an innate ability to project a humanoid shape and sized illusion of themselves. When their illusion has been dispelled (whether by themselves or by a magic user of a high enough skill), they appear as gigantic humanoid bats approximately 3 meters tall. High Vampires When a High Vampire bites another pangean, they have the ability to seal away another pangean's gift and replace it with High Vampirism, though other vampires and Revenants are immune to High Vampirism. Blending in seamlessly with their surroundings, High Vampires look exactly like they once did, and can change their facial and bodily features at will with innate magic. However, they cannot change their particularly long canines that develop upon being bitten.","title":"Pangeans of the Forgotten Times"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#pangeans-of-the-forgotten-times","text":"There's a story that goes back ages about the first humans that lived on the supercontinent of Pangea. The story goes that there were but a handful of families of humans and each was offered a gift by the elements that made up the world. What they received transformed the entire family into something new and great, and they went forth and spread across Pangea. The final family asked for nothing, but worried that the families who had so changed would forget about their shared roots. The elements offered them a gift not simply for them, but for all of the humans-- the gift of a magically shared language. No matter how different the humans became, they would always be able to understand one another. Gradually, these variations on humanity earned names for themselves to represent the gift that so shaped their lives. When children are born from parents of different gifts, they may take on one, the other, or a unique mixture of both gifts. As a result, there's no telling whether this is a complete list of the original gifts that were given-- there may yet be more varieties of humans out there with new and strange gifts. This page is currently under construction and may contain inaccurate references to old material.","title":"Pangeans of the Forgotten Times"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#dwarves","text":"These short, gray-skinned humanoids spend most of their lives underground, building huge underground cities and basing their economy around whatever they can mine. They are solitary pangeans that prefers to spend time among itself and have a deep reverence for stone and dirt. Dwarves have perfected the ability that they call \"life forging\", a combination of blacksmithing and magic that allows a group of dwarves gathered together to, when they perform the correct rites, take the soul of a near-dead dwarf and bind it into an object, creating a magical artifact that the near-dead dwarf can live in. Due to the near holy reverence that Dwarves give to stone, nearly all objects created this way are hewn from a single piece of stone. Depending on the rites performed the object can perform any variety of actions, but is typically limited to telepathically aiding and communicating with the person that is wielding the weapon.","title":"Dwarves"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#elves","text":"The idea of a beautiful creature so aligned with nature that it might have been there from the beginning almost spells 'Elf' in its description. Pangeans generally classified by their tall, slender appearance, and their uniquely shaped ears, the unique Elven facial structure is frequently quoted as being 'eerily beautiful.' Elves naturally grow to anywhere between 1.68-1.93 meters tall, and are frequently considered underweight for their height. Elves always have a particularly fair complexion, and have the natural array of human hair colors. Their facial structure is particularly angular, and they almost exclusively have almond-shaped eyes and tapered ears. Their distinctive and aesthetically pleasing appearances belie the natural Elven inclination to be obsessed with beauty. Most Elves are so wrapped up in appearing fair that they will surpress the urge to display emotions at the risk of marring their beauty. Many Elves have become so focused on it that they tend to be prejudiced against individuals who they don't consider to be 'beautiful'. This often leads Elves to be exceptionally selective with breeding and are not inclined to accept Half-Elves (those Elves sired in part by another pangean) into their midst due to their percieved impurity. This obsession with beauty also drives many Elves to experiment with modifying the world and its denizens with magic. If the world were to recognize them for what they were, it would be stunned by how frequently Elves were the culprit of it's favorite mythical creatures. The Elves are known for being reclusive, hiding themselves away in clusters of hidden cities referred to as the 'Elven Lands'. The Elves operate on a meritocracy, a government of officials selected on the basis of their individual ability. As such, it's not uncommon for Elven cities to feature prominently displayed Thieves guilds since they reason that if someone was stolen from, they could not protect the stolen property adequately and therefore didn't deserve to own it in the first place. Elven culture is firmly rooted in nature. Everything from their city names to their drinks tend to have names pertaining to trees or various plants or trees. Some of the largest Elven cities have a resident pair 'Grovemothers' or 'Grovefathers' who serve as the head of the community and commune with the surrounding trees and nature. The Elven lands are also filled with mysticism, with numerous areas reserved for 'Trials' or 'Rituals'. Religiously, most Elves tend to be Hexadivinites.","title":"Elves"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#faeries","text":"Apart from the slight hue change in their skin tone, Faeries appear in nearly every way identical to elves, but still somehow fall short of the beauty of the elves when compared. However, unlike Elves, the Faeries are heavily aligned with magical elements. Each Faerie has an alternate form that they can switch to, comprised of the element they are aligned to. While in this state, the Faerie is unable to communicate with anything not made up of that element and cannot access any of the items they had previously on them, before they transformed. They are still normally susceptible to nonmagical attacks, but can remove wounds from themselves by absorbing nearby objects and elements of their elemental alignment, such as a campfire for fire, rocks for earth, and ice for water. Additionally, while in their elemental state, the Faeries' innate magic potential is doubled.","title":"Faeries"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pangeans/#fae","text":"Fae are the light aligned, yellow hued Faeries, and are the most organized of the Faeries.

Animus Worshipper Title: Beneficiary Deities in Pantheon: Lunis , Father of Endings Sola , Mother of Beginnings Innumerable other Anima Creation of the World The Animus believe that the Arch-Anima are benevolent beings that created the world from lifeless scrap that existed in the universe. The Animus believe that both the universe and the Arch-Anima have always existed and always will exist, with or without their believers. The Animus pledge their lives to their \"benefactors\" as a sign of showing respect for the gift of life they were given. The End of the World The Animus believe that the universe and the Arch-Anima will always live forever, and as such have no thoughts on the end of the world beyond the fact that some day there will not be any Animus left to worship the Arch-Anima, prompting the Arch-Anima to create new life. The Deities' Role in the World The Anima believe that upon an area or grouping of people being consecrated by a priest of the Animus, a personal Anima will be created by the power of the Arch-Animi to watch over the consecrated location or individuals. Consecration is a high honor, and is typically only done if the group of people or the place is extremely important in the eyes of the Animus. Worship Practices Because Anima are created for specific locations or individuals, worshiping them is simply paying respect for their job. This can be done in any way the Animus determines, but is usually accomplished through feats of labor such as creating or maintaining a shrine or preparing regular offerings. It is generally believed that the more work done to honor the spirit, the more the worship is worth. What Makes a Priest Becoming a priest of Anima requires that the Animus who wishes to become a priest take a pilgrimage back to the original shrine of Sola in a valley in Eurasia, followed by a dangerous trek through a mountain pass to the original shrine of Lunis. At both shrines, an elder priest records the Animus' entrance and provides mentorship for the Animus. The Animus becomes a priest if they are deemed worthy by both mentors. The Afterlife The Animus do not believe in life after death -- instead, they believe their souls are absorbed back into the Arch-Animus from whence they came. Court of Celestials Worshipper Title: Celestate Deities in Pantheon: Primordial entities (not traditionally worshipped, but forces revered to hold great power) The Darkness The Light The Sisters of Radiance Avaria , Archangel of Justice and Trial Zeriate , Archangel of Protection and Divine Retribution Collete , Archangel of Ingenuity and Expression Gabrielle , Archangel of Law and Order Teviyas , Archangel of Good Will and Harvest Euriel , Archangel of Truth and Wisdom Serenia , Archangel of Peace and Prosperity The Sisters of Shadow Lilith , Archangel of Violence and Calamity Morrigan , Archangel of Temptations and Misery Creation of the World Celestate believe that the universe is the realm of Light. When the Light formed the universe, its radiance created nine Archangels known as the Court of Celestials to govern it from the Celestial Terrace. However, when the creation of sentient beings began, the Court began to disagree. Lilith and Morrigan jointly proposed the idea that all creatures should serve the council, and swayed Avaria and Gabrielle. However the other Angels, championed by Serenia and Collete, rejected the proposal claiming it \"Against the will of the Light.\" Sneering at their sisters, Morrigan and Lilith bided their time, drawing power from the Darkness to amass an army of Dark Angels and attacked the Celestial Terrace in an attempt to seize control. They were driven back by the forces of Avaria and Zeriate and sealed within the realm of the Darkness. To separate themselves from those whom they banished, the remaining seven archangels named themselves the Sisters of Radiance, sworn to the will of the Light. Meanwhile, instead of being defeated by their new prison, Morrigan and Lilith swore themselves to the will of the Darkness and named themselves the Sisters of Shadow. They used their new powers to manipulate the realm to create the Nether Sphere, a dominion which was their own twisted world. Teviyas abhorred the conflict between all of her sisters and attempted to convince the Sisters of Radiance to reform the Court, including the Sisters of Shadow. The Sisters of Radiance initially refused, but as cracks began to form between the realm of the Light and the realm of the Darkness, releasing all a manner of horrors. The Sisters of Radiance were only able to seal the rifts from the realm of the Light, leaving weakened barriers that could be torn back open quicker than the Sisters of Radiance could seal them. Teviyas out of pity and desperation went alone to the Nether Sphere to implore the Sisters of Shadow to help seal the rifts and rejoin the Court. To win their favor, Teviyas offered Lilith and Morrigan rule over the creatures of the realm of Light who strayed from the Light's will and the two reluctantly agreed to rejoin the Court. The Sisters of Radiance had little choice but to accept the Sisters of Shadow's return as their help from within the realm of Darkness permanently sealed the rifts between the two realms. The Court was reformed with renewed purpose to keep watch over where the barriers between the realms were weakest, but the universe is a vast place. Reluctantly, the Court agreed to allow the Sisters of Shadow to create all manner of afflictions to test mortals, that they might prove themselves to be worth the Court's protection. The End of the World The Order neither believes that any apocalypse is imminent, nor that the Darkness is completely evil. However, an offshoot known as the Templars believes Lilith and Morrigan are forming up an army in the Nether Sphere to take over the world. There are other, smaller, denominations of the Celestate who embody different interpretations of the Council's will, but they are of negligible importance. Speak to your GM if you would like to be a part of an offshoot. The Deities' Role in the World The Court primarily stays out of the affairs of the world. However, each Archangel is a guardian of an important virtue, and may affect the morals and events based around these virtues. Worship Practices Worshippers gather in a church and pray to the Court, singing their praises and asking for their guidance. Lilith and Morrigan are rarely worshiped, but when they are it is in an ancient, cult-like manner. What Makes a Priest Priests must go through schooling in which they focus on interpreting the will of a specific Archangel. The Afterlife Those who die and live a virtuous life become housed within the Council's halls, ruled over and protected by the Archangel which they most associate with. Those who do not become void spawn, the mindless servants of Lilith and Morrigan. Cults of the Twin Sisters of Shadows believe that the most loyal among them will become Dark Angels through a process called \"The Calling,\" which would allow them to keep their free will to more adequately serve Lilith and Morrigan. Deus Worshipper Title: Servant Deities in Pantheon: Magnempus , Deus of Storms Stelsolis , Deus of Stars Petraxan , Deus of Mountains Aequosa , Deus of Tides Iracun , Deus of Emotions Vitima , Deus of Life Noxorte , Deus of Death Astrus , Deus of Cunning Fata vel Fortuna , Deus of Luck Imperiadas , Deus of Order Berutum , Deus of Creatures and Freedom Sylvas , Deus of the Forests Creation of the World Those who follow the Deus pantheon believe that the world was created and every Deus born at the same time. As the world grew, so did the Deus-- for they were the world, and controlled its development. As the years rolled by, eventually they grew lonely with their power in the world. As the Deus grew more and more, they tried to fill the void they felt, accidently setting into motion the creation of the pangeans. Although this creation was accidental, the deities felt a new sense of purpose and responsibility and vowed to watch after this new life they created. The End of the World The Deus believe that the Gods are not immortal, but rather that they simply live for an incredibly long time. When the Gods start to die, the Deus believe that the world will begin to unravel. Similarly, any harm caused to the world is seen as harm caused to the Gods themselves. The Deities' Role in the World The Gods are the world, they alone prevent it from falling apart. Since the Gods are the world, they may intervene as they choose within their realm of expertise to protect those who worship them. Worship Practices Each Deus has no definitive gender, though when they manifest they may choose a gender for the avatar that represents them. As such, it's very common for a Deus in one era depicted as one gender to suddenly be depicted as a different gender in another era. Traditionally, each of the deities are worshipped separately in their own temples with massive gatherings to celebrate what the Deus stands for. Unlike most other pantheons, each Deus is viewed as separate entities and are worshipped separately. What Makes a Priest Priests of the Deus specialize in their knowledge of the teachings of individual Gods, however they are also expected to understand and respect the customs of other priests that worship the other Gods of the pantheon. A priest-to-be must make a pilgrimage to a temple of each of the Gods and be trained by an elder there, then return to the temple of their patron deity for special training before they are acknowledged as a priest of their deity. The Afterlife Deus believe that after death, their souls are taken to the underworld by Noxorte, where they spend their time reliving their life from others who experienced contact with the deceased Deus at any point in the Deus' life. This begins with the deceased themselves. Hexadivinus Worshipper Title: Hexadivinite Deities in Pantheon: Aurantiaco , Lord of the Orange Robe Elder God of Emotional and Physical Strength Associated with earth Caesitas , Lady of the Blue Robe Child Goddess of curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge Associated with water Luteus , Lord of the Yellow Robe Middle-aged God of elegant and purposeful order Associated with light Pureum , Lady of the Purple Robe Elder Goddess of elegant and purposeful chaos Associated with darkness Rutilun , Lord of the Red Robe Child God of emotional passion Associated with fire Viren , Lady of the Green Robe Young goddess of seduction, playfulness, and whimsy Associated with air Creation of the World All six of the the Lords and Ladies gathered together and worked together (for the first time) to create the universe and all therein as an elaborate environment for them to experiment on and play with. It is believed that they will not ever work together again until the end of the world. The End of the World Once the six are done with the universe, they will destroy it as their second collective action. The Deities' Role in the World The six desired a relatively infinite realm of mirrors of themselves (in different parts), and thereby created the universe, that they might live together as a family in practically infinite ways and places, experiencing practically everything. A piece of each god is in everyone, so the only way to grow as an individual is believed to be that you must praise them all. Amongst them, Rutilun cannonically pursues Viren and Caesitas, both goddesses whom he cannot have- wooing them with every power at his disposal, but ultimately failing each and every time. Luteus and Pureum play an incredibly large and extravagant version of chess constantly, and Aurantiaco watches them all, and simply observes the other five's antics, stopping them from ruining the universe, should any of the five do something extreme. Worship Practices Worshippers are expected to find their inner god/goddess, whichever one calls to them the most- and live out their life in praise to that god/goddess primarily, and the other five secondarily. The gender of the god/goddess has nothing to do with the gender of the individual who is called to live out their life (A woman could have her inner God be Rutilun, etc.). What Makes a Priest Priests are often defined as the best representatives of each lord and lady that are within the society- they are expected to act as much like the lord/lady they represent as they possibly can, from acting out legends to acting on only impulses that are thought to be from their specified god. The Afterlife Since each life is actually just one of the lords/ladies' lives, it is expected that they will join their inner diety in the Outside, where all the Gods sit and learn about how they lived- each life telling their story to the others in a never-ending stream of stories and experiences, each as precious as the last. Kol'lukt Worshipper Title: Challenger Deities in Pantheon: Vol'Kris , the Sky's Raptor A dinosaur-like feathered creature who leaps with blinding speed Dra'kolobrum , the Grinding Oblivion A serpent with a draconic head and many rows of acid-dripping teeth Ke'tu , Maw of the Deep An enormous eel-like creature with an awful unhinging jaw Kani'tres , the Voracious Flame A molten cerberus Invus , the Final Gatekeeper A terrifying combination of the previous four creatures, depicted in myriad ways Creation of the World Each individual has their own universe \"created\" when they are born as their own personal battlefield. Everything therein exists only to test them and make them stronger for the aftermath, when they will face the five colossi to determine their final resting place in the afterlife. The End of the World Each individuals universe ends as soon as they die, since they no longer need it for training. The possibility of the end of the creation and destruction of individuals is largely unexplored- as a kind of a... \"who cares\" sort of question. The Deities' Role in the World The colossi's only role in the world is to keep the challengers flowing at them, perhaps from instinct or perhaps to some inscrutable end. Challengers of Kol'lukt view it as common sense to worship them and learn as much as they can about them so they can focus on defeating them. Worship Practices Becoming a challenge for the colossi is the ultimate form of praise to them. Challengers welcome any form of strengthening themselves or putting themselves to the test, and often duel each other to this end. What Makes a Priest There are few priests of Kol'lukt, since most practitioners view the world as specially made for them to become stronger and see little point in sharing their beliefs with others around them. The priests that do exist tend to rely on their own fighting prowess, but can call upon the strength of previous combatants to augment their capabilities. These priests, however, know that when they finally die, they will not be able to rely upon borrowed help, but will have to face the colossi alone. For this reason, priests are incredibly uncommon. The Afterlife Worshippers believe that upon their death they are sent to face the five colossi in a gauntlet to determine their final resting place. Vol'Kris is the first challenge, followed by Dra'kolobrum, Ke'tu, Kani'tres, and Invus, in that order. If defeated by any of the colossi, the challenger is believed to then serve that colossi until they deign to allow that challenger to return to the mortal world to prepare and try the gauntlet again. The worst fate that could befall a challenger in the afterlife is if a colossi judges that they are not worthy of trying again, and they remain bound in servitude forever. Defeating all of the colossi results in joining the ranks of the Champions in the outer world, feasting and fighting and living forever in bliss with the other Champions. Magnusanctus Worshipper Title: Follower Deities in Pantheon: Magnusancte Creation of the World It is believed that Magnusancte created the universe and all in it in an endeavor to find the perfect people to fill his perfect city with, an ever-expanding utopia that he will always protect and always be loved by. The End of the World Once Magnusancte wishes to retire from judging everyone and just to simply live among his subjects, the gates of his city will close and the universe outside of his perfect city will be forced to remain alone with all of the evil of the world, forever without his guidance or protection. There are no apocalypse stories in Magnusanctus because his city is believed to endure forever. The Deities' Role in the World Magnusancte has only one role in the world- to watch over it and keep track of what everyone does and how they do it. Worship Practices Magnusancte is worshipped in a church by a fairly large group of worshippers, lead by their priest. The services are largely teachings of the importance of the seven tenants on which Magnusancte will judge everyone: Purity, Gentleness, Diligence, Altruism, Steadiness, Communion, and Humility. What Makes a Priest Priests of Magnusancte are expected to study the seven different tenants with seven different teachers and dedicate their life to them. After studying under their seven mentors, the new priest is expected to go forth and teach a unique combination of what they learned, teaching others the way of Magnusancte. The Afterlife It is believed that the dead go before Magnusancte after they have died, seeking entry to his perfect city. If they pass his judgement, they will be allowed in. If they do not, they will be cast out and forced to live outside the city's walls with the evil of the world in a land of perpetual harsh conditions, natural disasters, and hordes of dangerous beasts.","title":"Pantheons of the Forgotten Times"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#pantheons-of-the-forgotten-times","text":"Legends speak of pantheons of deities that populated the Forgotten Times who granted their followers with a flow of magic through divine covenants, offering miracles for worship.","title":"Pantheons of the Forgotten Times"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#animus","text":"Worshipper Title: Beneficiary Deities in Pantheon: Lunis , Father of Endings Sola , Mother of Beginnings Innumerable other Anima","title":"Animus"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#creation-of-the-world","text":"The Animus believe that the Arch-Anima are benevolent beings that created the world from lifeless scrap that existed in the universe.

Defeating all of the colossi results in joining the ranks of the Champions in the outer world, feasting and fighting and living forever in bliss with the other Champions.","title":"The Afterlife"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#magnusanctus","text":"Worshipper Title: Follower Deities in Pantheon: Magnusancte","title":"Magnusanctus"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#creation-of-the-world_5","text":"It is believed that Magnusancte created the universe and all in it in an endeavor to find the perfect people to fill his perfect city with, an ever-expanding utopia that he will always protect and always be loved by.","title":"Creation of the World"},{"location":"worlds/earth_the_forgotten_times/pantheons/#the-end-of-the-world_5","text":"Once Magnusancte wishes to retire from judging everyone and just to simply live among his subjects, the gates of his city will close and the universe outside of his perfect city will be forced to remain alone with all of the evil of the world, forever without his guidance or protection.
