                <h1 id="tests-of-ability">Tests of Ability</h1>
<p>Whenever a character attempts to do something with a goal in mind, a risk present, and an uncertainty of whether either or both will happen, the gamemaster will call for a test of ability to determine what happens next. A <strong>test of ability</strong> (or <strong>test</strong> for short) is resolved by rolling an <em>attribute</em> die, along with some combination of <em>skill</em> and <em>background</em> dice to meet or exceed a number that represents the difficulty of doing what they want to do.</p>
<p>While most tests emerge fluidly from gameplay and don't require this level of detail, a fully written test would look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant</strong></p>
<p><em>Difficulty <strong>15</strong> Test of <strong>Presence</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Turning a profit on contraband</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> The merchant is upset or involves the authorities</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>On a critical failure:</strong> the merchant refuses to do business with you ever again and tips off the authorities</li>
<li><strong>On a failure:</strong> the merchant refuses and threatens to involve the authorities</li>
<li><strong>On a success:</strong> you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal</li>
<li><strong>On a critical success:</strong> not only does the merchant accept the deal but they happen to be a known fence in the area and look forward to working with you again</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="establishing-difficulty">Establishing Difficulty</h2>
<p>Most of the time, the difficulty is a static number determined by the gamemaster based on the skill required to achieve success with minimal risk. Below are a collection of difficulty rules of thumb. When creating a test, it's a good idea to start with a difficulty based on one of the rules of thumb and increase or decrease it by a few points depending on how easy or difficult the test is meant to be.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talented but inexperienced</strong> characters can handle tests of difficulty <strong>5</strong></li>
<li><strong>Experienced</strong> characters can handle tests of difficulty <strong>10</strong></li>
<li><strong>Professionals</strong> can handle tests of difficulty <strong>20</strong></li>
<li><strong>Experts</strong> can handle tests of difficulty <strong>30</strong></li>
<li><strong>Masters</strong> can handle tests of difficulty <strong>40</strong></li>
<li>Only <strong>Legendary</strong> characters can attempt to handle tests of difficulty <strong>50 or higher</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Players, the difficulty rules of thumb can also help you gauge your character's proficiency. If you're regularly rolling above a 15 on a test, chances are you are on the same level as someone who performs those sorts of tests for a living. Gamemasters, if you choose to use more than three skill milestones and three attribute milestones, you should consider writing your own rules of thumb not only to help yourself consistently apply difficulties across your world, but also to help your players understand what rolling a 10 means when compared to the rest of your world's citizens.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="competitions">Competitions</h3>
<p>When characters directly compete with each other, the gamemaster may rule that it is appropriate to resolve the test by comparing each competing character's roll against each other instead of against a static difficulty. In these <strong>competitions</strong>, the rolls of the other competing characters are considered the difficulty of the test.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="resolving-tests">Resolving Tests</h2>
<p>In most cases the gamemaster will determine what attribute(s) are applicable for the skill check in question and the player will offer up suggestions of skills and/or backgrounds that they have on their character sheet to add the dice associated with those skills and/or backgrounds. A character can contribute one skill or background die to a test of ability up to the total amount allowed by their earned <a href="/character/milestones/">skill milestones</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="aid">Aid</h3>
<p>Before the dice are rolled, any character who can reasonably use one of their skills or backgrounds to help the character performing the test may offer their aid by choosing the appropriate die and rolling it with the character attempting the test. The character attempting the test may then choose a number of dice up to the total amount allowed by their earned  <a href="/character/milestones/">skill milestones</a> to use for the test.</p>
<p>All characters who aid in the test help the tested character reach their goal, making success more likely, but each character who aids in the test also either introduce a new risk to the test or somehow worsen the existing risk, making failure all the more dangerous. If the initial risk was a deadly pitfall, the aiding character could be at risk of falling in as well. If the initial risk was taking too long to researching an antidote before the poison took hold, the additional minds involved might result in a fatal miscommunication.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="outcomes-of-tests">Outcomes of Tests</h2>
<p>Once the attribute, backgrounds, and skills are all chosen, the dice are rolled and the gamemaster compares the total result to the difficulty of the test and describes what happens. If a character's roll meets or exceeds the difficulty of the skill test they do whatever they set out to do and have minimized any associated risk. If a character's roll does not meet the difficulty of the test, things get complicated. That doesn't necessarily mean that they don't accomplish their goal, but there will be certainly be dramatic consequences.</p>
<p>If a character rolls particularly well or particularly poorly compared to the difficulty of the test, the outcome should be that much more significant. When a character rolls more than 10 below the difficulty of a test they suffer a <strong>critical failure</strong> and the risk realized becomes dramatically greater. Conversely, when a character rolls more than 10 above the difficulty of a test they have performed a <strong>critical success</strong> and not only do they complete whatever goal they set out to do but they also gain some kind of significant added benefit-- perhaps their success avoids all risk, or their success is to a degree that none thought possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 id="progress-as-an-outcome">Progress as an Outcome</h4>
<p>Sometimes a goal is to make <strong>progress</strong> on a larger goal that can't be resolved by just one test, such as when the goal is making something complicated, taking out an enemy, or working as a crew to steer a ship through obstacles. The GM will create a progress meter for the overarching goal of the tests the players-- a total number to reach in order to accomplish the overall goal. Any tests that help accomplish the overall goal can help fill the meter. You can represent this meter just by a total number to hit, or you can draw it on a piece of paper to help illustrate the overall progress, whatever works best for your group.</p>
<p>When a character <strong>critically fails</strong> on a test meant to help fill the meter they instead make things more complicated, either by falling victim to an existing risk or introducing a new one. When a character <strong>fails</strong> on a test to help fill the meter, they fill the progress meter by half of what they rolled. When a character <strong>succeeds</strong> on a test to help fill the meter, they fill the progress meter by what they rolled. When a character <strong>critically succeeds</strong> on a test to help fill the meter, they fill the progress meter by twice what they rolled.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 id="outcomes-in-competitions">Outcomes in Competitions</h4>
<p>In all competitions, the risk each character faces in a competition is related to placing poorly compared to other competitors and the goal for each character in a competition is related to placing well. As a result, outcomes in competitions are better represented by ranking the competing characters from best to worst. which the gamemaster can then use to describe the result of the competition based on the relative placement of the competitors.</p>
<p>In the case of a runaway winner or a thoroughly outclassed loser, the result of the competition is similarly dramatic to a standard test. A character who beats all other competing characters by 10 or more are considered to have dramatically blown away the competition by performing a <strong>critical success</strong>, gaining the benefits of a critical success as outlined above. A character who is beaten by 10 or more is considered to have been completely outclassed by the competition and suffers a <strong>critical failure</strong>, suffering the penalties of a critical failure as outlined above.</p>
<p>Let's bring it all together and walk through a test of ability using the <strong>Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant</strong> example above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thief character attempts to <em>turn a profit on some contraband</em>. Since this is an action that carries the risk of <em>the merchant becoming upset or involving the authorities</em> and some uncertainty between which of the goal and the risk will occur, the gamemaster calls for a test of ability.</p>
<p>Given the social nature of the action, the gamemaster says that convincing the merchant is going to be a test of <em>Presence</em> and secretly marks down a difficulty of <em>15</em>, since they rule that this requires professional expertise.</p>
<p>On the thief's character sheet are the backgrounds <em>Smuggler</em> and <em>Mercenary</em>, as well as the skills, <em>Acrobatics</em>, <em>Lockpicking</em>, and <em>Intimidation</em>. Based on their current goal, they choose their background <em>Smuggler</em>, and their skill <em>Intimidation</em> as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation.</p>
<p>The gamemaster agrees that these are good choices, so the thief rolls their 1d10 Presence, 1d6 Intimidation, and 1d12 for their Smuggler background.</p>
<p>They roll a 2, a 1, and a 3 for a total of 6--  not a great roll. Fortunately, they have a +5 attribute modifier to their Presence, bringing the total of the roll up to 11.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the difficulty of the test was <em>15</em>, so an 11 is a <em>failure</em>, which means <em>the merchant refuses and threatens to involve the authorities</em>. Based on the skills used, the gamemaster now has everything they need to paint a picture of how merchant responds to the smuggler who just attempted to intimidate them, describing how <em>the merchant refuses and threatens to involve the authorities</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="good-tests">Good Tests</h2>
<p>A test of ability is fundamentally useless without a <strong>goal</strong>, a <strong>risk</strong>, and an <strong>uncertainty</strong>. Without uncertainty, the narrative already clearly indicates what will happen and to roll the dice could introduce uncertainty that breaks immersion. Without a goal, the roller's agency is subverted-- if they don't know what they're trying to do, the number rolled doesn't mean anything to them. Without a risk, failure has no weight and the test is drained of tension. The concept of goals and risks is something that relies on the players being immersed in their character, their surroundings, and the world at large. If you're playing with a bunch of people new to the system, take some time in an introductory dungeon to help your players think in terms of the goals they want to perform and the risks that might come with them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="goal-guidelines">Goal Guidelines</h3>
<p>Goals are a statement of intent and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. Gamemasters, this is the part of skill checks that fall on the players to define. You should be prepared to ask questions until you are absolutely certain of the intention of the player's actions. If a player doesn't know what they are trying to do in the situation, the gamemaster should present some options like you might find in a choose-your-own-adventure novel.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="risk-guidelines">Risk Guidelines</h3>
<p>Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as taking a chainsaw to the chest, and should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night or missing a crucial detail.</p>
