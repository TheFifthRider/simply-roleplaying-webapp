# Action Scenarios
When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, the timing of when each character can do what is critically important. **Action scenarios** are so named because they are the stuff that action movies are full of. Action scenarios are turn based and typically follow the same rules, however some types of action scenarios may define special things you can do with your actions that fit the theme of the scenario.

## Rounds

Action scenarios are turn based and take place over blocks of time referred to as **rounds**. A full round usually is considered to take ten seconds of game time, but gamemasters may adjust this based on what makes sense for the action scenario. Most of the time, each character involved in the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking a **turn** in a specific order.

## Actions

On their turn each character can take **up to 3 actions**. One **action** on its own can be used to do something quick that does not require much complex thought. Running a short distance, making an attack, jumping a gap, climbing a ladder, hiding behind a pillar, or triggering a mechanism are all examples of actions.

### Spending Multiple Actions

A character can spend multiple actions in succession to do something complicated or time consuming. Casting a spell, repairing broken machinery, deciphering a complicated message, rolling a boulder out of the way, or hacking a computer terminal are examples of things that might take multiple actions.

If the character does not have enough actions to do something completely, they can still spend what actions they have towards the total cost of whatever they want to do. Until the full cost is paid, they are considered to be **focusing** on it. If they use an action to do anything else, their progress is lost.

If it makes sense, a character who is focusing on doing something can be helped by other characters on their turns, allowing the group to speed up the process of doing something particularly complicated or time consuming by working together.

## Reactions

In addition to the actions that they can perform on their turn, characters can also **react** to another character's action, performing one action in response. Characters can only react once per round. If they do not react by the start of their next turn, they may perform **one extra action** on that turn. Some examples of reactions are ducking behind cover, dodging away from a fatal blow, closing a door, or activating a simple mechanism.

<br/>

## Chases

Chases are a special kind of action scenario that capture the fast back-and-forth between participants in a race. Unlike other action scenarios, there's no reacting in chases. In addition, there are several special actions that can be performed in a chase, [detailed here](chases.md).

## Freeform Action Scenarios

The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when observing strict rules for an action scenario would get in the way of the drama of the scene. A **freeform scenario** is any scenario that uses some, but not all, rules that are normally a part of an action scenario. This allows each character the freedom to act as would make sense to the scenario.
