## Attacking with a Weapon

Attacking with a weapon is a [test of ability](../basics/tests.md). The attribute for the test can be any of the attributes that the weapon is tagged with, and the difficulty of the test is the [armor value](../basics/equipment.md) of the target. Success on the test means dealing damage equal to the amount the attacker rolled, a critical success means double damage, a failure means half damage, and a critical failure means do damage at all.

As an example, here's the test for attacking an armor value 15 target using a greatsword with the tags _brawn_, _melee_, _large_, _cleaving_, and _slashing_:

>  **Attacking with a Greatsword**
>
>  _Difficulty **15** Test of **Brawn**_
>
>  ****
>
>  **Goal:** Striking the target and inflicting injury
>
>  **Risk:** Not inflicting any damage <!-- TODO: Review, what really is the risk here? Is it really just not inflicting as much damage as hoped? -->
>
>  ****
>
>  * **On a critical success:** the target [takes damage](../basics/damage_and_injuries.md) equal to double the attacker's total for the test.
>  * **On a success:** the target [takes damage](../basics/damage_and_injuries.md) equal the attacker's total for the test.
>  * **On a failure:** the target [takes damage](../basics/damage_and_injuries.md) equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down.
>  * **On a critical failure:** the target takes no damage.

### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes, it makes sense that a character can attack with an object not intended to be a weapon or with a weapon in a way that it's not intended to be used. Examples of this could be using a table leg as a cudgel, throwing a maul, or bashing with the butt of a sniper rifle. Attacking in this way technically may violate the range or attributes tagged on the weapon, but should always be possible.

Your gamemaster may rule that a character can use this weapon or object to attack with whatever attribute makes sense for the situation but using it in this way carries an **additional risk** of **being damaged, destroyed, or otherwise lost** in test of ability associated with the attack. For more on risks, see [Making Good Tests](/character/tests#Making-Good-Tests). In addition, **the gamemaster may say that some tags on the weapon do not apply**-- bashing with the butt of a rifle, for instance, would likely not benefit from the rifle's quality tag, since the quality likely refers to its utility as a ranged weapon, not as a cudgel.

As an example, here's a possible test for attacking an armor value 15 target using the butt of a sniper rifle with the tags _agility_, _long-range_, _large_, and _precision_:

>  **Attacking with the Butt of a Sniper Rifle**
>
>  _Difficulty **15** Test of **Brawn**_
>
>  ****
>
>  **Goal:** Striking the target and inflicting injury
>
>  **Risk:** Not inflicting any damage, breaking or damaging the Sniper Rifle <!-- TODO: Review, what really is the risk here? Is it really just not inflicting as much damage as hoped? -->
>
>  ****
>
>  * **On a critical success:** the target [takes damage](../basics/damage_and_injuries.md) equal to double the attacker's total for the test.
>  * **On a success:** the target [takes damage](../basics/damage_and_injuries.md) equal the attacker's total for the test.
>  * **On a failure:** the target [takes damage](../basics/damage_and_injuries.md) equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down, and the sniper rifle jams or is otherwise unusable for a short time.
>  * **On a critical failure:** the target takes no damage and the sniper rifle gets bent or broken in the scuffle and requires repairs.
