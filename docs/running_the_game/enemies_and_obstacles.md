# Enemies and Obstacles

Along with the responsibilities of creating tests, as a gamemaster you will likely need to create enemies and obstacles for your players to overcome. It's perfectly reasonable to create characters using the [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md) process, but it's not recommended because there's a number of moving pieces in a fully fledged character creation that don't really matter for a character who only shows up for a maximum of a couple of scenes.


## Enemies

Enemies are simplified characters -- you usually don't need to know their attributes, skills, legacies, or backgrounds. Instead, an enemy will rely on their level and you can just assume that they will always roll a number of d12s equal to their level. To make an enemy more interesting, you can give them strengths and weaknesses in the form of different levels for different attributes or [basic actions](../gameplay/basic_actions.md).

Enemies are usually either **bosses** or **minions**. The big difference between the two is that **bosses** may take multiple [injuries](../character/health.md#injuries) before they are defeated, but minions only get one.

    * [ ] \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
    * [ ] Defeated: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Enemy Abilities

Once you've got the hang of enemies, you can start introducing [abilities](../character/abilities.md) to your enemies to make them still more interesting. Unlike player characters, enemies don't work as well with ability points because they only tend to use their abilities when they're making trouble for the player characters. Instead, consider limiting enemy abilities by [requirements](../running_the_game/creating_abilities.md#requirements) like abilities that go on cooldown for a certain number of turns, or abilities that only unlock after taking a certain number of injuries.

!!! error "**The Lost Kaiserwulf** (Level 6)"
    30/30 Health 
    
    * [ ] Defeated: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
    
    <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Maw of Mort**: Roll 9d12 to attack, then stack 2/3/4d12 _chomped_ against your target using the same roll. They can't move while chomped.
    
    <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **CHOMP**: Attack a target you have _chomped_ for 9d12.
    
    <i class="fa-solid fa-person-walking"></i> <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **Feral Lunge**: Move 5 spaces, then make two 6d12+5 attacks against all targets within close range. 
    
    üîÇ **Ever Reassembling:** When the initiative is passed to you, if you are defeated unmark your defeated status.

## Obstacles

Obstacles are like enemies, but even simpler. Usually they can perform one or two basic actions, and often in response to players doing something. Unlike enemies you usually can't just hit obstacles until they are defeated, so they'll have some other condition for defeating them.

!!! warning "Trapped Hallway (Level 1)"
    **To defeat:** Pass a difficulty 5 test to spot and a difficulty 5 test to disarm the tripwire.
    
    <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **The Traps Activate!:** Swinging blades attack anyone in the hallway for 2d12!

Obstacles can also be almost indistinguishable from an enemy, except the party needs to do something clever to defeat them!

!!! warning "The Devouring Tree (Level 6)"
    **To defeat:** Make progress until you can force your way through the roots that block the entrance and exit. 
    
    60/60 Entrance
    
    60/60 Exit
    
    üîÅ **Aversion to Flame:** If a character uses fire as a part of a test against the tree, they get +10 to their roll.
    
    <i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Branches and Vines Entangle:** Hinder a target by _entangling_ them as if you rolled a 60. They can't move while they are _entangled_. 
    
    <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **Devouring Maw:** Drag anyone who is _entangled_ a short distance towards the maw and attack them for 9d12.
