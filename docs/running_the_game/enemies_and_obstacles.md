# Enemies and Obstacles

Along with the responsibilities of creating tests, as a gamemaster you will likely need to create enemies and obstacles for your players to overcome. It's perfectly reasonable to create characters using the [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md) process, but it's not recommended because there's a number of moving pieces in a fully fledged character creation that don't really matter for a character who only shows up for a maximum of a couple of scenes.

## Enemies

Enemies are simplified characters -- you usually don't need to know their attributes, skills, legacies, or backgrounds. Instead, an enemy will usually _only_ have a level and will always roll that many d12s on a test. If an enemy has a particularly powerful attack or ability, that attack or ability might have a different level than the rest of the enemy.
