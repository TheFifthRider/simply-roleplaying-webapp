# Enemies and Obstacles

Along with the responsibilities of creating tests, as a gamemaster you will likely need to create enemies and obstacles for your players to overcome. It's perfectly reasonable to create characters using the [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md) process, but it's not recommended because there's a number of moving pieces in a fully fledged character creation that don't really matter for a character who only shows up for a maximum of a couple of scenes.


## Enemies

Enemies are simplified characters -- you usually don't need to know their attributes, skills, legacies, or backgrounds. Instead, an enemy will rely on their level and you can just assume that they will always roll a number of d12s equal to their level. To make an enemy more interesting, you can give them strengths and weaknesses in the form of different levels for different attributes or [basic actions](../gameplay/basic_actions.md).

Enemies are usually either **bosses** or **minions**. The big difference between the two is that **bosses** may take multiple [injuries](../character/health.md#injuries) before they are defeated, but minions only get one.

### Enemy Abilities

Once you've got the hang of enemies, you can start introducing [abilities](../character/abilities.md) to your enemies to make them still more interesting. Unlike player characters, enemies don't work as well with ability points because they only tend to use their abilities when they're making trouble for the player characters. Instead, consider limiting enemy abilities by [requirements](../running_the_game/creating_abilities.md#requirements) like abilities that go on cooldown for a certain number of turns, or abilities that only unlock after taking a certain number of injuries.
