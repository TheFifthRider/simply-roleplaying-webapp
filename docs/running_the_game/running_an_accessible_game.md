# Running an accessible game

Tabletop roleplaying should be for everyone, so it's critical to examine your game to make sure it actually is for everyone, and provide the necessary accomodations for the players and the characters. Accesibility in gaming comes in many forms, including sharing images that inspire your descriptions of places, taking and sharing notes at the gaming table, and considering the accessibility needs of the fictional adventuring party themselves!

There are many groups who have explored accessibility to a deeper extent than I do here, such as the group of volunteers at [Everyone Games](https://everyone-games.com) who host an annual online event highlighting accessibility and Knights of the Braille who have gathered this list of [accessibility resources](https://knightsofthebraille.com/accessibility/).

## Accessible theater of the mind

A significant amount of the tabletop roleplaying experience is spent imagining the world. As a GM, you will often be responsible for describing this world and bringing it to life, however this can be a daunting challenge for you to present and for some players to process.

To help with this, consider sharing images that inspire the characters and scenes that you're describing! If you're running a published adventure that includes graphics and handouts, this can be really easy. If you're not, you don't necessarily need to go overboard-- even just a rough sketch in paint of the layout of the tavern or a quick image search for a character that looks similar to what you're describing can go a long way.

## Character accessibility

Consider the accessibility needs of the characters in your game -- not just accessibility needs that we typically consider, but also accessibility in the fantastical needs of the character that a player might want to play. A centaur would have just as difficult a time with a ladder as someone with limited mobility, and a giant would be unable to traverse a cramped tomb that was built with dwarf-high hallways.

To solve this, simply offer multiple options for interacting with the world. Dungeons whose entrance might otherwise only have a ladder or stairway could have a pressure plate elevator or sloped cavernous entrance. Anecdotally, considering character accessibility often tends to help make your spaces make _more_ sense. If goblins have been living in the mines, surely they would have a cart-accessible entryway to bring food, water, and supplies into their living space. 

Aside from the obvious importance of making accomodations for disabilities, considering character accessibility is also important because you don't want to create environments that are hostile to the concept of a character that a player wants to play. It's just not fun to play a giant and want to explore your massive size only to be told that you have to be shrunk to human size for this dungeon (or worse, be excluded from the adventure), because it only has human sized hallways.
