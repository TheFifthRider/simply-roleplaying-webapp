# Running the game

Running the game is similar to playing the game, but with the added responsibility of preparing the story that your players will explore.

## Preparing for Sessions

There are many ways that you can prepare for sessions as a GM, I find I like to ask myself a series of questions to answer in as much or as little detail as I'd like to. This list was inspired by [Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/return-of-the-lazy-dungeon-master) and modified over time, but I highly recommend you check out the original book.

* What should we talk about before the game begins?
* Where is each player character physically and emotionally?
* What happens that draws the players into this session?
* What juicy scenes might happen?
* What secrets and clues might be uncovered?
* What rewards could the player characters learn about or earn?
* Where might the players go?
* Who might they run into?
	* Make a list of 10 names with pronouns for characters your players talk to that you didn't plan for!
* What [enemies and obstacles](../running_the_game/enemies_and_obstacles.md) might the party face?
* What do you want to remember for next time?

### Sets

_Where might the players go?_ Can be answered with a list of **sets** that the players can visit, like in a movie or a play.

Something like:

> **Thundarkkroff, Throne of the Tyrant**
>
>A jagged black-rock mountain peak, streets that switchback across rising steps of elevation. Tall, gothic cathedral-like structures that rise up like individual spires made from dark dressed stone. Iron decorations and empty windowframes like twisted black spiderwebs. The wind is unnaturally stagnant, held still by divine favor. The air is choked with iron and fresh smoke. Ash coats fingertips as you brush anything. Deep in the mountain, an ominous thrumming protests your presence.

The goal of the description of the set is to capture evocative phrases that are hard to improvise. You don't need to read them all in succession to your players as soon as they set foot on the set, it's just good to weave in one or two every time you're describing a character's surroundings or actions.

### NPCs

_Who might they run into?_ Can be answered with a description of an NPC.

Something like:

> **Kinapak, the Red Ringed Rose.** She/thou. Level 7 undying assassin, legend that guides the Thorns. Lucatiel of Mirrah.

Simpler even than [enemies](../running_the_game/enemies_and_obstacles.md), most NPCs only need a name, pronouns, a brief description of who they are, and-- if the players are likely to roll agains them --a level. It can also be helpful to write down the name of a character from media that you can hold in your mind's eye to describe and act like the NPC.
