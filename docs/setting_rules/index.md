# Setting Rules

Not every setting plays by the same rules. A campaign focused on high seas adventures might have detailed naval rules while a campaign focused on superheroes and villains might instead focus on unique powers and abilities.

When running your own game of Simply Roleplaying, you may find that you want to create your own rules for minigames, world mechanics, or whatever else that makes your campaign special! Check out the other pages in this section for mechanics that I built for my worlds to help get you started. Pages that start with "building" are guides for building the same sort of thing for your world, and everything else are examples!
