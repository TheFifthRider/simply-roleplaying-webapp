# Tag-based Alchemy
With a few hours of downtime, you may combine 1-3 materials with alchemical tags to create a potion (or poison) with an effect improvised based on their tags. Alchemical tags, just like other tags, can be applied to things when they are relevant. You can research alchemical tags of ingredients that don't obviously have alchemical tags.

When you do so, test your alchemical knowledge to craft the potion or poison against a difficulty based on strong the created effect would be, or against your **passive knowledge** if the effect would scale on your level (eg: poisons-- the difficulty to resist naturally scales on your level)
