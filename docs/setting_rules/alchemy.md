# Alchemy

Items can be marked with alchemy tags to indicate that you can use the brew action to combine them together into magical elixers.

With a few hours of downtime and the apropriate tools, you may combine 1-3 materials with alchemy tags to create a potion or poison with an effect improvised based on their tags.

Brewing is just like crafting -- [making progress (on something big)](../gameplay/basic_actions.md#make-progress-on-something-big). Test your alchemical knowledge to craft the potion or poison against the potion's progress bar, which your GM will set based on how powerful the created potion or poison is. Then, you produce as many doses as progress bars you can fill with your roll. 

You can create potions and poisons by only partially filling a progress bar as well. If you've filled it at least half way you can choose to complete the potion, but mark it with an asterisk and let your GM know. When you use it, tell your GM that it's marked with an asterisk -- they may say it has unexpected side effects.

## Alchemy Tags

Alchemy tags, just like other tags, can be applied to things when they are relevant. You can spend some downtime to research alchemy tags of ingredients that don't obviously have alchemy tags. 

In general, alchemy tags represent the properties that can be derived from the object. They can be as literal as tagging some wool as "fluffy", or as poetic as tagging cold iron with "lunafaction." Here are a list of a few alchemy tags to get you started:

* A classical element (fire, earth, water, air)
* Life
* Death
* Comfort
* Ethereal
* Magical
* Social
* Contention
* Attraction
* Relaxation
