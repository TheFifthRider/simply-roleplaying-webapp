Earth: The Forgotten Times is set on the earth before the time of the tower of Babel, with the erection of the tower of Babel being fact and the ending of the time period that all stories within Earth: The Forgotten Times. In this campaign world, there is a wise and benevolent magic user and warrior named Xeanth who watches over and ensures that the world heads down the time stream that is most beneficial for it. Often he will choose champions, which usually is how any major arc in this campaign world occurs. In addition to the rest of that, Dragons are mythical creatures in this campaign world, created only artificially through high level transformation magic, magic that is only wieldable by a select few individuals.

These individuals are known as the Guardians. There is one for each of the four basic elements (Air, Earth, Fire, and Water) and they are chosen by being bound to one of the elemental orbs. Each of these orbs was used in the creation of the planet, and so are tied to preserving its integrity, and have a corresponding artifact made of an unknown indestructible material that appears to be some form of gemstone, each a different color to represent their element; air is green, earth is orange, fire is red, water is blue. The Guardians are lead by Xeanth who is the Guardian of balance and time. He wields the twin blades Genistellatempus and Everstellatempus, the blade that can heal any wound and the blade that can destroy anything respectively. Sometimes, he will wield only one or niether of these blades. In this case, it is not uncommon for guardians of dark or light to appear in the campaign world, wielding either Genistellatempus if they are the guardian of light, or Everstellatempus if they are the guardain of darkness.

The main enemy of the Guardians is Heagar, who has been imprisoned in eternal slumber within the center of the world because it proved impossible to kill him. Heagar is massive, and literally encompasses the planet hundreds of kilometers below the surface. Should he awaken, he will destroy the world because that is what he was born to do. Heagar was one (and technically still is) a guardian and a human, but has lost himself to the madness of being required by the universe to destroy. Heagar is not a peaceful sleeper, however, and even while asleep he can manifest in the world and cause trouble.
