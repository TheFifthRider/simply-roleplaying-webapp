# Running a Playtest

Blah blah blah playtest blah

## World Creation

If you already have a world that you want to run SRP in, you can skip this step. Otherwise, collaboratively build the world with your table.

To begin, ask each player to roll 1d12.

The highest rolling player chooses a location that they can describe in a sentence or less.

Ex:
> An amusement park.

The lowest rolling player chooses a genre that they can describe in a sentence or less.

Ex:
> Super Sentai. We will save the world from evil with the power of our superpowered suits. 

Then, in roll order, everybody else gets to make one statement about the world that is true.

Ex:
> Snails are the mascot of the amusement park, and coincidentally also the source of our suits powers.

If there are lots of players or the world does not feel finished, all players can continue to provide suggested worldbuilding facts until the gamemaster has a solid grasp of the story they want to tell in this world.
