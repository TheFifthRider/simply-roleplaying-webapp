# Attributes

Attributes represent your broad strengths and weaknesses-- from how much weight you can lift to how quickly you react. Whenever the gamemaster asks you to make a [test](../gameplay/tests.md), they're going to tell you that it's a test of a certain attribute. Add that attribute to your level to determine how many dice you're going to roll. Attributes are assigned an initial value in [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md) and you can increase them when you [level up](../gameplay/advancement.md).

<br/>

## The Attributes

**Agility** measures your physical speed and precision. If you have high Agility, you're probably dexterous, flexible, and swift.

**Brawn** measures your physical strength and endurance. If you have high Brawn, you're probably strong, athletic, and resistant to maladies.

**Intuition** measures your gut instincts. If you have high Intuition, you're probably observant, perceptive, and quick to react and adapt to change.

**Knowledge** measures your memory and problem solving. If you have high Knowledge, you're probably able to solve complicated puzzles, craft sophisticated objects, and remember intricate details.

**Presence** measures your social skills and natural charm. If you have high Presence, you're probably amiable, convincing, and socially adept.

**Will** measures your drive and resolve. If you have high Will, you're probably determined, independent, and collected in the face of hardship.

## Improving Attributes

Whenever you level up, you can increase two attributes by 1, as long as you don't increase them past your attribute cap. The **attribute cap** is +1 at level 1, and increases by +1 every two levels. That means the cap is +2 at level 3, +3 at level 5, and so on.

`Attribute Cap = level/2, rounded up`

## Passive Attribute Scores

You don't always have to roll to resist risks! Whenever you are reflexively opposing a risk, your gamemaster will use one of your attribute's **passive scores** instead of asking you to roll the dice. For each attribute, your passive attribute score is equal to six times the total of your level plus that attribute -- the same as if you rolled all the dice you could for a test of that attribute and got a six for each of them!

`Passive Score = 6 x (level + Attribute)`

> An advisor tests their _Presence_ to manipulate their monarch by feeding them fabrications. Even though the monarch has no reason to suspect the advisor of lying, their experience in politics might tip them off. In this case, that experience is represented by their passive _Presence_ score.
>
> The monarch is a level 4 character with a _Presence_ of +2. Their passive _Presence_, and the difficulty of the advisor's test, is 6 x (4 + 2) = 36.

<br/>

> A young wizard tries to tiptoe past their sleeping master, testing their _Agility_ to silently swipe the master's fabled wand, risking getting caught red handed and getting turned into a newt _or worse_. Because the master is asleep, the difficulty of the test is the master's passive _Intuition_ score-- how likely the master's instincts are to wake them up from the noises their apprentice makes.
>
> The master is a level 5 character with an _Intuition_ of +3. Their passive intuition, and the difficulty of the Apprentice's test, is 6 x (5 + 3)  = 48.
