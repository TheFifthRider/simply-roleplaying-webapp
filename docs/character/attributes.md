# Attributes

Whenever the gamemaster asks someone to make a [test](../gameplay/tests.md), they're going to tell you that it's a test of a certain attribute. Attributes are numbers that represent the broad strengths and weaknesses of a character, from how much weight they can lift to how quickly they react. When you roll dice for a [test of ability](../gameplay/tests.md), you add the associated attribute to whatever you rolled on the dice. Attributes are assigned an initial value in [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md) and you can increase them by spending [potential](../gameplay/advancement.md#potential).

## The Attributes

**Agility** is the measurement of a character's physical speed and precision. Characters with high Agility are often dexterous, flexible, and swift.

**Brawn** is the measurement of a character's physical strength and endurance. Characters with high Brawn are often strong, athletic, and resistant to maladies.

**Intuition** is a measure of a character's gut instincts. Characters with high Intuition are often observant, perceptive, and quick to react and adapt to change.

**Knowledge** is a measure of a character's memory and problem solving. Characters with high Knowledge are often able to solve complicated puzzles, craft sophisticated objects, and remember intricate details.

**Presence** is a measure of a character's social skills and natural charm. Characters with high Presence are often amiable, convincing, and socially adept.

**Will** is a measure of a character's drive and resolve. Characters with high Will are often determined, independent, and collected in the face of hardship.

## Improving Attributes

At the end of each session, or during a scene where it [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth), you can spend two points of potential to increase one of your attributes by 1. However, if your character is level 1, you cannot increase your attributes to greater than +3. 

Whenever a character levels up, this **attribute level cap** increases by 3. That means the cap is +6 at level 2, +9 at level 3, and so on.

`Attribute Cap = 3 x level`

## Passive Attribute Scores

You don't always have to roll to resist risks! Whenever you are reflexively opposing a risk, your gamemaster will use one of your attribute's **passive scores** instead of asking you to roll the dice. Level 1 characters have passive attribute scores equal to that attribute plus six, and the value increases by 6 every time you level up. That means level 2 characters add 12 to their attributes to get their passive scores, level 3 characters add 18, and so on.

`Passive Score = Attribute + 6 x level`

> An advisor tests their _Presence_ to manipulate their monarch by feeding them fabrications. Even though the monarch has no reason to suspect the advisor of lying, their experience in politics might tip them off. In this case, that experience is represented by their passive _Presence_ score.
>
> The monarch is a level four character with a _Presence_ of +9. Their passive _Presence_, and the difficulty of the advisor's test, is 9 + (4 x 6) = 33.

<br/>

> A young wizard tries to tiptoe past their sleeping master, testing their _Agility_ to silently swipe the master's fabled wand, risking getting caught red handed and getting turned into a newt _or worse_. Because the master is asleep, the difficulty of the test is the master's passive _Intuition_ score-- how likely the master's instincts are to wake them up from the noises their apprentice makes.
>
> The master is a level three character with an _Intuition_ of +8. Their passive intuition, and the difficulty of the Apprentice's test, is 8 + (3 x 6)  = 26.
