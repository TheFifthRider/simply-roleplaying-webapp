# Attributes

Attributes are the measurement of a character's intrinsic ability, from how strong they are to how quickly they seize up situations. Attributes get added to the dice rolled as a part of [tests of ability](../gameplay/tests.md). Attributes are assigned an initial value in [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md) and you can increase them by spending [potential](../gameplay/advancement.md#potential).

<br/>

## The Attributes

**Agility** is the measurement of a character's physical speed and precision. Characters with high Agility are often dexterous, flexible, and swift.

**Brawn** is the measurement of a character's physical strength and endurance. Characters with high Brawn are often strong, athletic, and resistant to maladies.

**Intuition** is a measure of a character's gut instincts. Characters with high Intuition are often observant, perceptive, and quick to react and adapt to change.

**Knowledge** is a measure of a character's memory and problem solving. Characters with high Knowledge are often able to solve complicated puzzles, craft sophisticated objects, and remember intricate details.

**Presence** is a measure of a character's social skills and natural charm. Characters with high Presence are often amiable, convincing, and socially adept.

**Will** is a measure of a character's drive and resolve. Characters with high Will are often determined, independent, and undeterred by hardship.

## Attribute Level Cap

While you can increase attributes at any time by spending potential, attributes for a level 1 character cannot be increased to beyond **+3**. Whenever a character levels up, this cap increases by 3 -- so your attribute level cap can always be determined by multiplying your character's level by 3.

`Attribute Cap = 3 x level`

<br/>

## Passive Attribute Scores

Character's don't always have to roll to resist risks. Whenever a character is reflexively opposing a risk they use an attribute's **passive score** instead of rolling the dice. You can calculate your character's passive score by increasing that attribute's modifier by 6 for each of your **dice**!

`Passive Score = Attribute + 6 for each die`

> An advisor tests their _Presence_ to manipulate their monarch by feeding them fabrications. Even though the monarch has no reason to suspect the advisor of lying, their extensive experience creates a difficulty of their passive _Presence_ score-- how likely they are to notice the social signs of mistruth.
>
> The monarch is a four dice character with a _Presence_ modifier of +9. Their passive _Presence_, and the difficulty of the advisor's test, is calculated as 9 + (4 x 6) = 33.

<br/>

> A young wizard tries to tiptoe past their sleeping master, testing their _Agility_ to silently swipe the master's fabled wand, risking getting caught red handed and getting turned into a newt _or worse_. Because the master is asleep, the difficulty of the test is the master's passive _Intuition_ score-- how likely the master's instincts are to wake them up from the noises their apprentice makes.
>
> The master is a three dice character with an _Intuition_ modifier of +8. Their passive intuition, and the difficulty of the Apprentice's test, is calculated as 8 + (3 x 6)  = 26.
