# Backgrounds and what make them

Where attributes represent broadly a character in broad strokes, skills, legacies, and backgrounds are more specific. Having a d12 in Brawn means you're strong, but having a d12 in Brawn, a d8 in your _Wrestling_ skill, a d10 _Giant Wrestler_ legacy, and a background called _The Thighcrusher_ paints quite the vivid picture. **Skills** represent trained capabilites, **legacies** represent things that you've done or you're known for, and **backgrounds** represent who your character is by combining several d12 skills and/or legacies together.

<br/>

## Improving Skills and Legacies

Every skill and legacy starts out at d4 and can grow to be as powerful as d12. Whenever you spend some downtime doing something that improves the skill or legacy, you can spend potential to acquire a skill or legacy you did not have, writing it down as a d4 skill or legacy, respectively, or to level up an existing skill or legacy to the next largest die size.

<br/>

### Developing Skills

Whenever you spend [downtime](../gameplay/downtime.md) to **take some time to train** or **gain a flash of insight**, you can spend potential to either **learn** a new skill that you do not have written down on your character sheet or to **level up** a skill that you do have written down on your character sheet.

How a character **takes some time to train** varies from individual to individual, but usually involves several hours of [downtime](../gameplay/downtime.md#training-a-skill), a trainer, and/or suitable materials to study from. A character can act as a trainer for a skill provided that it pertains to one of their backgrounds. This means that a character can train themselves in a skill once they've incorporated it into a background!

A character **gains a flash of insight** in the moment. You can declare you gain insight right before making a test of ability, right after, or even by watching someone else do something awesome. Whenever it makes sense, a player may declare that their character has **gained insight** in either a skill that was used or in a skill that could have been used in the situation.

<br/>

### Earning Legacies

Whenever you **do something memorable** or **act like your reputation**, you can spend potential to either **start** a new legacy that isn't written on your character sheet, or **level up** a legacy that you already have written down.

**Doing something memorable** sounds broad, and that's because it is! Doing something memorable might be joining a faction, making an enemy, or saving a town. Any time you do anything that underscores your character's values in a way that other characters can talk about it, that's something memorable.

**Acting like your reputation** is exactly what it sounds like. Whenever you do anything that your character is known to do, even if you haven't written it down on your character sheet yet, that's acting like your reputation.

<br/>

### Renaming a Skill or Legacy

Leveling up a skill or legacy can also be an opportunity to refine it. Whenever you level up a skill or legacy you can also rename it to better represent the skill or legacy that your character is developing.

> A character with the skill _Spotting Traps_ narrowly avoids the last arrow trap of a dungeon and _gains insight_, spending a point of potential to level up the skill. As they reflect on how it might be less useful back above ground, they decide to rename the skill to _Quick Reflexes_ as they level it up.
>
> A character with the legacy _Wanted Pickpocket_ acts like their reputation and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy by formally accepting membership to the Blackgrass Thieves' Guild. Not wanting to limit themselves to picking pockets, they change the name of the legacy to _Blackgrass  Thieves' Guild Member_.
>
> A character with the skill _Research_ spends days trying to crack the secrets of an alien artifact, working with a librarian to help train them in getting better at researching. To represent both the newfound knowledge and to help them get more specific answers in the future, they decide to rename the skill to _Extraterrestrial Research_ as they level it up. 
>
> A character with the legacy _Monster Hunter_ does something memorable by landing the killing blow on the dragon who has been terrorizing the countryside and spends a point of potential to level up the legacy. Since slaying a dragon is surely more impressive than the other creatures they've defeated, they decide they'd rather the legacy be named _Dragonslayer_.

<br/>

### Abandoning a Skill or Legacy

Sometimes a skill or legacy might not work out for your character. Maybe it was too specific, just isn't very useful in the long term, or your character has had a shift in priorities such that what you wrote down no longer makes sense for them. In that case, you can always choose to **forget**. During any period of [downtime](../gameplay/downtime.md#forgetting-a-skill), you may decrease the die level of one of your skills or legacies to reclaim one point of potential. This can represent the public's waning attention to your deeds in the case of a legacy, or your character losing interest in or forgetting about that skill in preparation to learn something new.

<br/>

## Building a Background

Once a character has three related d12 skills and/or legacies, they can take a few hours of [downtime](../gameplay/downtime.md#creating-a-background) to reflect and combine them together to form a **background** that summarizes the aspect of the character that is reflected by those three skills and/or legacies. Backgrounds can be added to any test that their name implies that they would be useful for and are worth a d12 when added to a test.

> A character has a d12 in the skills _Acrobatics_ and _Lockpicking_ as well as a d12 in the legacy _Robs from the rich to feed the poor_, it would make sense for them to be able to combine them together into a background called _Robin Hood of Crookshack Row_.

When a character develops a new background, the skills and legacies combined into that background are erased from their character sheet, as their new background includes those skills/legacies. If a character wishes to, they can start legacies or learn skills with the same name again. If they do, these new legacies and skills represent additional reputations and capabilities beyond what their backgrounds describe.

<br/>

### Leveling up Backgrounds

If a character has three d12 skills and/or legacies that are related to one of their existing backgrounds, instead of creating a new background they can choose to level an existing background up. Higher leveled backgrounds can be used multiple times on a test, up to a number of times equal to their level.

To level up a background, a character takes a few hours of [downtime](../gameplay/downtime.md#leveling-up-a-background) and erases the three related d12 skills and/or legacies, just like when creating a background. Then, they rename the background to represent the expertise gained and mark down the new level of the background.

> A roguish character with the _Robin Hood of Crookshack Row_ background has a d12 in the legacy _Thief of Luiena's Crown_, as well as a d12 in the skills _Sneaking_ and _Traps_. These skills and legacies all are relevant to the _Robin Hood of Crookshack Row_ background so rather than add a new background they choose to level up their existing background to _Crownthief of Staedbergh (Level 2)_.

<br/>

### Renaming a Background

Characters change. Getting better at the stuff your backgrounds reflect can be easily shown by creating new backgrounds that represent the new skills you've learned. However, sometimes it makes sense for the name of a background to change to better reflect the character that it's representing.  A **Bloodthirsty Warlord** may become a **Repentant General**, an **Assassin for Hire** may become a **Silencer of the Court**, or a **Master Blacksmith** might become the **Silversmith of Ardent**. Sometimes the change is less story driven and more that you've come up with a better name to describe that grouping of skills. That's fine too! Backgrounds should be renamed until you're happy with them. After all, backgrounds exist to express your character.

<br/>

## Naming Guidelines

The trickiest part about being able to create your own skills or backgrounds is coming up with a good name. You want your names to keep a balance between the general and the specific. Ideally, your skills, legacies, and backgrounds should be expressive of what you want your character to be able to do while still remaining general enough that they can come up a lot in play.

Don't worry too much about coming up with the perfect name, it's often good enough to just create a good name. Skills and legacies are just the building blocks of backgrounds and backgrounds should be renamed until they feel right.

<br/>

### Naming a Skill

Names for skills are fairly rigid. Skills should describe a specific thing that your character has trained in. The more general the name of a skill is, the more generic the character's expertise is considered to be. A character with a _History_ skill would be able to apply it to broad questions about the past of a town, but wouldn't likely be able to apply that knowledge to find the age of the ancient catacombs under the town like a character with an _Archeology_ skill. Conversely, a character with an _Archeology_ skill wouldn't likely be able to apply it to uncovering facts about the recent political unrest of the town.

<br/>

### Naming a Legacy

Legacy names should focus on your character's reputation and things they've done, but should also represent the developing nature of the legacy. Legacies can be a phrase describing your displayed values, a title awarded, or anything else that showcases your budding reputation. Legacies are also a great space for representing ranks in factions-- joining any faction and advancing in rank are both definitely doing something memorable, and acting in line for that faction will always be acting like your reputation.

 Since the way that you level up your legacies is by **doing something memorable** and **acting like your reputation**, make sure to think about how you'll level up your legacy as you write it down! _Robbed a noble_ can likely only be leveled up whenever you rob someone or talk about how you did, but _Steals from the rich to feed the poor_ can be leveled up in that way and whenever you perform an act of charity!

<br/>

### Naming a Background

Names for backgrounds are more freeform. A good rule of thumb is to name your background something that you might use in a sentence to describe your character. Backgrounds could be jobs like _Blacksmith_, _Hacker_, or _Guerilla Sniper_, roles like _Healer_, _Tactician_, or _Tank_, or even quick descriptions like _Born in a Port City_, _Penny Pincher_, or _Iron Will_. Really, there's not much of a definition for what a background can or can't be; if it sums up both an aspect of your character and a spectrum of skills, it's probably a good background!

<br/>

### Additional Examples

Here are some additional examples of skills based on a attribute they work well with, and some background examples of how they might be combined. While skills are never limited by what attribute you use them with, sometimes thinking about what attribute you want to improve will help you decide on what kind of skill to learn.

Skills to augment _Agility_ tests primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are _Acrobatics_, _Rubix Cube Solving_, and _Sneaking_. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named _Criminal Mastermind_.

Skills to augment _Brawn_ tests primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples are _Breaching Doors_, _Lifting_, and _Swimming_. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named _Military Commando_.

Skills to augment _Intuition_ tests primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples are _Driving_, _Gambling_, and _Streetwise_. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named _Getaway Driver_.

Skills to augment _Knowledge_ tests primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples are _Bandit Culture_, _Political History_, and _Sewing_. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named _Gang Savvy Granny_.

Skills to augment _Presence_ tests primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples are _Animal Handling_, _Bluff_, and _Political Appeal_. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named _Druid Politician_.

Skills to augment _Will_ tests primarily focus on a character's ability to shut out distractions or act despite hardship. Some examples are _Acting under Pressure_, _Ignoring Pain_, and _Spirit_. If you were to combine those three skills, you could create a background named _Force of Nature_.
