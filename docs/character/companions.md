# Companions

Companions are characters that adventure alongside your character-- be they a mentor, a sibling, or an animal with whom you've formed a lasting bond. There are two types of Companions, Helpers and Allies.

## Helpers

Helper companions just have a [background](../character/skills.md) that describes them, which can be used like any other background on your character sheet to assist you in [tests](../gameplay/tests.md). Because helpers are just a background, they generally don't have to contend with risks from tests and are often small or can hide away somehow.

## Allies

Allies are a bit more complicated-- they have their own pool of health, attributes, attribute modifiers, passive attributes, equipment, and their own background. However, allies only progress when you do and cannot have their own potential. To make an ally, follow the [creating a character](../getting_started/creation,md) steps, except allies have health equal to the maximum roll of their Brawn die and Allies must be created with a background instead of taking the starting pool of potential.

While allies cannot learn new backgrounds of their own, they can use any background on your character sheet that references them. In addition, whenever you hit a  milestone rank the companion's modifiers from highest to lowest. Increase the modifiers of the companion's two highest attributes by +4, the second two highest by +3, and the last two attributes' modifiers by +2.

In combat, your ally goes at the same time you do. Either you or your ally can take a major action, but not both. Both you and your ally can take a minor action. Because Allies have their own health, attributes, and equipment, they're almost a second character! Expect them to get into scrapes and have to contend with risks.
