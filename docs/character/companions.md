# Companions

Companions are characters that adventure alongside your character-- be they a mentor, a sibling, or an animal with whom you've formed a lasting bond. There are two types of Companions, Helpers and Allies.

## Helpers

Helper companions just have a [background](../character/skills.md) that describes them, which can be used like any other background on your character sheet to assist you in [tests](../gameplay/tests.md). Because helpers are just a background, they generally don't have to contend with risks from tests and are often small or can hide away somehow.

## Allies

Allies are a bit more complicated-- they have their own pool of damage, attributes, passive attributes, equipment, and their own background. However, allies only progress when you do and cannot have their own potential. Because Allies have their own health, attributes, and equipment, they're almost a second character! Expect them to get into scrapes and have to contend with risks.

While they may have their own pool of damage, you share injuries with any ally companions you have. Allies also cannot learn new backgrounds of their own, but they can use any background on your character sheet that references them. They also share the three actions you can perform in an action scenario, but your characters and allies can perform any actions which make sense together.

To make an ally, answer the [creating a character](../getting_started/creation,md) questions, but skip **What Makes you Unique** (allies share your ability points and other unique stuff) and Allies must be created with a background instead of taking the starting pool of potential. Whenever you level up, rank the companion's attributes from highest to lowest. Increase the companion's two highest attributes by +3, the second two highest by +2, and the last two attributes by +1.
