# Companions

Companions are characters that adventure alongside your character-- be they a mentor, a sibling, or an animal with whom you've formed a lasting bond. There are two types of Companions, Helpers and Allies.

## Helpers

Helper companions just have a [background](../character/backgrounds.md) that describes them, which can be used like any other background on your character sheet to assist you in [tests](../gameplay/tests.md). Because helpers are just a background, they generally don't have to contend with risks from tests and are often small or can hide away somehow.

## Allies

Allies are a bit more complicated-- they have their own pool of damage, attributes, passive attributes, equipment, and their own background. However, allies only progress when you do and cannot have their own potential. Because allies have their own health, attributes, and equipment, they're almost a second character! Expect them to get into scrapes and have to contend with risks.

There are also a few rules to remember when playing with allies:

* **Allies share your injuries!** While they may have their own pool of health, you share injury boxes and their associated injuries -- and if one of you gets defeated, you all are. 
* **Allies share your backgrounds!** Allies cannot learn backgrounds of their own, but they can use any background on your character sheet that references them. 
* **Allies take their turn with you!** Allies share the three actions you can perform in an action scenario, but you and your allies can perform any actions which [make sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth) (often movement) as one action.
* **Allies get stronger when you do!** Whenever you increase one of your attributes, you can increase one of each of your allies' attributes as well!
* **Allies get healthier when you do!** Whenever you increase your health, you increase their health.
* **Allies can use your abilities!** As long as it [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth) to do so, allies can use any of your abilities from your character sheet. You should totally make teamwork related abilities for them!

To make an ally, answer the [creating a character](../getting_started/creation,md) questions, but skip **What Makes you Unique**, since allies share your ability points and other unique stuff. Allies also must be created with a background instead of taking the starting pool of potential.
