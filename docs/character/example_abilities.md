* **First Level Spells**: 4/4 Slots
  * **Magic Missile**: Spend up to three actions and a spell slot of first level or higher to create one dart of magical energy per action spent.

If you spent a spell slot of second level or higher, create an additional dart for each spell slot above first.
  * **Shield**: When someone targets you, you can spend a reaction and a spell slot of first level or higher to roll **1d10** and add it to your AV until the start of your next turn. In addition, damage taken from spells is reduced by the result of your roll.

  * **Alarm**: Ward an area within **Short-Range**. Choose Silent Alarm or Audible Alarm, and any number of creatures who can come and go as they please. For the next 8 hours, if anyone not chosen enters the area, the chosen alarm will sound. A silent alarm alerts you through a mental ping that wakes you up, as long as you are within 5km. An audible alarm alerts everyone in the vicinity by creating the sound of a hand bell for the next ten seconds.
* **Second Level Spells**: 3/3 Slots
  * **Augury**: You can spend some downtime and a spell slot of second level or higher to ask a question of the GM about the outcome of actions you will undertake immediately following the downtime. The GM can answer your question only with vague portents-- either "Weal" for good fortune, "Woe" for bad fortune, "Weal and Woe" for a mix of both, and "Neither Weal nor Woe" if the answer is neither good nor bad fortune. If you've already cast this spell once since the last time you've rested, the GM rolls 1d4 in secret for each time you've cast the spell since the last time you've rested. If they roll any 1s, they must give you a random answer.
