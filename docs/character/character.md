# What Makes Up a Character?

A character in Simply Roleplaying is made up of several different pieces. If you're creating a character for the first time, you may want to check out the walkthrough in [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md). The content on this page and that page are almost the same, this one is just aimed at breaking everything on your character sheet down while that page is aimed at walking you through setting it up.

## Total Dice

**Total dice** represents your general power level. This is the number of dice you can roll from your attributes, skills, and backgrounds.

## Damage and Injuries

[Damage](damage_and_injuries.md#damage) is how much damage you can take before you sufffer an [injury](damage_and_injuries.md#injury), which take some time to recover from. If you take too many injuries, you'll be [defeated](damage_and_injuries.md#defeat) and the worst of the bad stuff will happen to you.

## Attributes

[Attributes](attributes.md) are broad categories which represent your strengths and weaknesses-- your physical strength, ability to quickly respond, willpower, and more. Any time you make a [test of ability](../gameplay/tests.md), it will use one of these attributes. An attribute has a die that it's associated with, a [modifier](attributes.md#attribute-modifiers) that you add to any roll of that die, and a [passive attribute score](attributes.md#passive-attribute-scores) for when you respond reflexively to that attribute being tested.

## Skills and Backgrounds

[Skills and Backgrounds](#skills.md) are what you've learned. [Skills](skills.md#honing-your-skills) are anything concrete that you can get better at, given practice. [Backgrounds](skills.md#building-a-background) are broader phrases built from skills that explain what you're good at.

## Abilities

[Abilities](abilities.md) are the unique and cool things your character can do. Casting magic, building inventions, or memorizing crucial details all can go here. [Ability points](abilities.md#ability-points) are a pool of points that you can spend on doing cool ability stuff.

## Inventory

Your [inventory](equipment.md) is filled with all the stuff you own. Anything you can use to accomplish a task is usually a piece of [equipment](equipment.md#equipment) and has [tags](equipment.md#tags) that describe its properties. Items in your inventory are either equipped or not-- equipped items are usually visible and easy to get to, unequipped items are stored away somewhere on your person.

## Companions

Your [companions](companions.md) are anyone else who travels with you, but doesn't need a full character sheet to represent them. A [helper](companions.md#helpers) offers you the support of their skills. An [ally](companions.md#allies) has attributes, damage, and inventory of their own, but shares your total dice, injuries, skills, backgrounds, and abilities.
