# Abilities

**Abilities** are the special things that your character can do, the things that make your character mechanically unique. Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the [weapon](equipment.md#weapon) tag, their unique [power](../extras/powers.md) allows them to do something extraordinary, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details!

For every **10 potential earned** (not spent) choose to either [gain a new ability](#gaining-new-abilities) or [improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities)

## Gaining new Abilities

If you choose to **gain a new ability**, your character learns a new ability. If your GM has a list of abilities for you to choose from, you can choose one of those, or you can create your own.

### Creating an Ability

An ability is composed of a **charge** that describes how often you can use it, a **trigger** that describes when it happens, and an **effect** that describes what it does. A finished ability reads something like this: 

| Charge        | Trigger             | Effect                      |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Once per rest | when I attack I can | add an extra d4 to my roll. |

To create a new ability, pick a trigger and an effect. The charge for the ability will be **once per rest**.

### Example Triggers and Effects

Here are a few examples of triggers and effects to get you started. Not all of the triggers or effects listed here are created equal. You can look to your gamemaster for guidance on what abilities are balanced combinations.

| Trigger                                                      | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| When I'm in a specific situation I can...                    | ...do  something extraordinary.                              |
| I may spend (1, 2, 3, ... ) actions to...                    | ...increase 1 target's Armor Value by 1d4 until the end of their next turn. |
| I may spend downtime to...                                   | ...give 1 target 1d4 that they can use to perform a specific action. |
| When I use equipment with a specific tag I can...            | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll.                              |
| When I do something related to a specific background I can... | ...recover from an injury.                                   |
| When I take a specific action I can...                       | ...roll 1d4 and recover that much damage.                    |
| When I make a specific test I can...                         | ...move up to my speed.                                      |
|                                                              | ...give an equipment a specific tag until the end of my next turn. |

## Improving Existing Abilities

Instead of gaining an ability, you can enhance an existing ability.

### Making an Ability Stronger

Amplify the effects
*    Add/increase number of targets
*    Add/increase area of effect
*    Increase duration
     *    1 turn
     *    1 scene
     *    1 session
     *    forever
*   Just generally increase magnitude

### Giving an Ability an Additional Effect

*   Add a new **effect** to an existing **ability**

### Making an Ability more Flexible

*   Increase the **recharge** of an existing ability (name charges thematically)
*   Add a new **trigger** and **effect** to that ability which can be used by spending the same **recharge**

#### Passive advancement

At certain numbered milestones, dice increase and equipment granted by abilities become more powerful.

| Milestones | Die  | Modifier |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- |
| 0          | 1d4  | +0       |
| 1          | 1d4  | +1       |
| 2          | 1d6  | +2       |
| 3          | 1d6  | +3       |
| 4          | 1d8  | +4       |
| 5          | 1d8  | +5       |
| 6          | 1d10 | +6       |
| 7          | 1d10 | +7       |
| 8          | 1d12 | +8       |
| 9+         | 1d12 | +9       |
