# Abilities

**Abilities** are the cool mechanics that show off what makes your character awesome. Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the [weapon](equipment.md#weapon) tag, their [power](../extras/powers.md) over gravity allows them to temporarily lift massive objects, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details!

This section is written assuming that players and GMs will work together to create cool abilities, but you can also decide to create and curate a list of abilities that characters are able to choose from and that's a fine way to play too! That's the way most TTRPGs work, after all.

<br/>

## What do Abilities do?

Abilities do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway.

Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them. If you want to make an ability called *Godmode* that *makes you immortal.* Go for it. Just make sure you check with your GM and the rest of the table-- they may not want to play a TTRPG where somebody has cheat codes on. Of course, that's not to say that characters shouldn't be overpowered! Protagonists with the ability to shape the world to their whim can create a compelling story. Just make sure that everyone is on the same page and having fun, that's what matters.

### Ok, but what do they usually do?

Often, a character's abilities will do things like:

*   Inflict [damage](damage_and_injuries.md)
*   Make a test to heal [damage](damage_and_injuries.md)
*   Create an [advantage or disadvantage](../gameplay/advantages_and_disadvantages.md)
    *   ...which could be a [special advantage or disadvantage](../gameplay/advantages_and_disadvantages.md#Special Advantages and Disadvantages)
*   Give some [equipment](equipment.md) a specific [tag](equipment.md#the-full-list-of-tags)
*   Allow someone to do something as if they had equipment with a specific [tag](equipment.md#the-full-list-of-tags)
*   Move the character where they want to be
*   Move someone else where the character wants them to be
*   Do something narratively extraordinary

If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a [Test of Ability](../gameplay/tests.md) to resist the effects, setting the **Difficulty** and describing what happens if they **Critically Succeed**, **Succeed**, **Partially Succeed**, or **Fail**.

<br/>

## Requirements

Every ability has **requirements** that must be met for you to be able to use it. The more requirements an ability has, or the more costly the requirements, the more powerful the ability should be. Often, requirements will be things like:

* Wielding a specific tool, like being required to _use weapons specific to your art_ to use a martial arts technique
* Being in a specific situation, like being required to be _defending against a melee attack_ to perform a counter
* Spending a specific resource, like being required to _spend mana_ to cast a spell
* Taking a specific amount of time, like being required to _spend some downtime_ to create a potion
* Fulfilling a specific narrative goal, like being required to _memorize a character's mannerisms_ to disguise yourself as them

The most basic kind of requirement that almost every ability has is a cost, usually in the form of the character's ability points.

<br/>

## Costs and Ability Points

A **cost** limits how many times an ability can be used before a character has to rest or resupply. An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! 

Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of **ability points**. This is a chance to personalize how your character plays, so consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do? If you're not sure, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later. 

You start with a pool of **2** of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you [spend some downtime to recover](../gameplay/downtime.md#recovering). You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their _mana_ from leylines. A might be able to replenish their _ammunition_ in an arsenal.  A leader might replenish their _pride_ from cheering throngs of admirers.

### Creating Multiple types of Ability Points

Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their _mana_ to use abilities related to their magic power might also have _flourishes_ that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both _ammunition_ for their arsenal of weapons and _psi points_. An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions.

You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you only gain that many ability points in total-- you must choose which of your types of ability points increase.

### Customizing Ability Points

If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it.

If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities.

<br/>

## Upgrading Abilities

As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either **give them an extra effect** or **make them stronger**.

### Giving an Ability an Additional Effect

Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. If an ability gave you an extra **d6** when gathering information about a monster, giving it an extra effect might allow you to create a **1d6** [advantage](../gameplay/advantages_and_disadvantages.md) named _I know_ [monster name]_'s strengths and weaknesses_ as well. If an ability allowed you to give equipment the _blessed_ and _weapon_ tags, adding an extra effect might let you make a test of _presence_ to heal the wielder too!

### Making an Ability Stronger

If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. If an ability would push a target away from you, a stronger version of the ability might be able to push everyone within a _close range_ of you away instead. If an ability would grant you an extra _d4_ when wielding weapons tagged with _cleaving_, a strengthened version of the ability might give you an extra _d4_ with _cleaving_ or _hooking_-tagged _weapons_. Stronger abilities typically increase the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broaden the situations in which an ability might apply.

<br/>

## When do you get or improve Abilities?

You earn new abilities and upgrade existing abilities by earning [potential](skills.md#honing-your-skills). Every **10 potential you earn** (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two.

At the end of any session, you can reduce your maximum ability points by **1** to [learn a new ability](#creating-an-ability), or reduce your maximum ability points by **2** to [improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities). 

If you happen to have multiple pools of ability points you may reduce any one of them by **1** to learn a new ability, or **2** to improve an existing ability. You can also reduce two of them by **1** to improve an existing ability.

<br/>

## Abilities Growing with Milestones

When making an ability, you may not want all aspects of the ability to be improved by a player choosing to **improve an ability**-- increasing the difficulties for tests, the size of bonus dice, or the **+X** tag on ability-created equipment aren't things that necessarily feel rewarding to level up. Improving an ability should always feel like an improvement, it should never feel like keeping up.

To that end, certain aspects of abilities should increase automatically as a character earns additional milestones. Bonus dice granted by an ability, for example, might start as d4s at Milestone 0 and increase every two milestones until Milestone 8, when they become d12s. Test difficulties might increase by 5 every milestone. Here are some suggestions:

| Milestones | Die  | Equipment Quality | Test difficulty |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------------- | ------- |
| 0          | 1d4  | +0                |10|
| 1          | 1d4  | +1                |15|
| 2          | 1d6  | +2                |20|
| 3          | 1d6  | +3                |25|
| 4          | 1d8  | +4                |30|
| 5          | 1d8  | +5                |35|
| 6          | 1d10 | +6                |40|
| 7          | 1d10 | +7                |45|
| 8          | 1d12 | +8                |50|
| 9+         | 1d12 | +9                |55|

You can also tie effects to things that are automatically improved every milestone like maximum damage, passive ability scores, and total dice.

## Let's Make Some Abilities

All right, we've spent enough time talking about how they work. Let's make some ability points and an ability to use them.

### Tinkering Inventor

What if our character was a _Tinkering Inventor_? Someone who can always make the right tools for the job. Their abilities could be the inventions they create, powered by the **scrap** that the Inventor uses to make them. One ability could be **Springloaded Boots**-- a cobbled together contraption that allows the wearer to leap further and run faster... until it breaks. That's pretty easy to represent as an advantage that the Inventor puts together over some downtime.

Ability points: **Scrap**
Ability: **Springloaded Boots**

| Requirements                                     | Effect                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can... | ...give 1 target a 4d4 advantage called Springloaded Boots. |

And upgrading it would probably mean making the boots last longer and be more durable, so we can just increase the number of dice on the advantage

| Requirements                                     | Effect                                                       |
| :----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can... | ...give 1 target an **8**d4 advantage called Springloaded Boots. |

<br/>

### Alchemist

What if our character was an _Alchemist_ who produced poisons and potions? Their abilities could be the various potions effects they know how to make, powered by the **concoctions** that the Alchemist brews when the party rests. One ability could be a **Health Potion** that heals a bit of damage.

Ability points: **Concoctions**
Ability: **Health Potion**

| Requirements                                       | Effect                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| By spending 1 concoction I can use an action to... | ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach. |

We could then upgrade this potion to give it a secondary effect-- perhaps an invigorating advantage?

| Requirements                                       | Effect                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending 1 concoction I can use an action to... | ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach and give them a 2d4 advantage called _Invigorated_. |

<br/>

### Unassuming Assassin

What if our character was an _Unassuming Assassin_? Someone small or frail who nonetheless is a lethal threat. Their abilities could be powered by their ability to mentally note their enemy's weak spots with **assassin's marks**. One ability could be **Strike Their Weaknesses**-- a technique to make attacks with anything based on intuitive analysis rather than strength or speed.

Ability points: **Assassin's Marks**
Ability: **Strike Their Weaknesses**

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending an assassin's mark when I'm hidden from my target I can... | ...make attacks as though my weapons had the **intuition** tag until the end of my turn. |

Upgrading this ability might allow us to add another tag, maybe the _concealable_ tag.

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending an assassin's mark when I'm hidden from my target I can... | ...make attacks as though my weapons had the **intuition** and **concealable** tags until the end of my turn. |

<br/>

### Internet Savant

What if our character was an _Internet Savant_ who mastered the art of utilizing the collective human knowledge present on the web? Their abilities could be powered by their **cellular data**. A core ability of theirs could be **There's a Wiki for That**, because of course there is.

Ability points: **Cellular Data**
Ability: **There's a Wiki for That**

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| By spending a point of cellular data when I spend some downtime to research information I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. |

Upgrading this ability might allow the Savant to utilize some tidbits they picked up when researching as an advantage.

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of cellular data when I spend some downtime to research information I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll and give myself an appropriately titled 4d4 advantage based on what I researched. |

<br/>

### Street Brawler

What if our character was a _Street Brawler_ who was used to using anything at their disposal in a scrap? Their abilities could be powered by their **reputation** as a fighter. An ability of theirs could be **Everything's a Weapon in My Hands**, letting them improvise weapons from whatever they can grab.

Ability points: **Reputation**
Ability: **Everything's a Weapon in My Hands**

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of reputation when I'm using equipment without the **weapon** tag... | ...I can give it the **weapon** tag for the scene. _(The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one)_ |

Upgrading this ability could make those weapons more lethal by giving them an extra tag.

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of reputation when I'm using equipment without the **weapon** tag... | ...I can give it the **weapon** tag for the scene. It also gets the **+1** tag if it isn't already tagged with a bigger **+X** tag. _(The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one)_ |

<br/>

## Improving an Ability Throughout a Campaign

Here's a more in-detail example of how one could make an ability stronger over the course of multiple enhancements.

Let's start with the ability **Berserking**

#### Berserking

| Requirements                                           | Effect                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. |

A good starting point, but let's see if we can make it more interesting.

The next chance we get to improve abilities, we choose to **make the ability stronger**. We can't increase the number of dice that we have, but we can change the dice into an **advantage** that can be used more than once. Since advantages are more broadly useful than just attacks, let's also change the trigger to an action.

#### Berserking II

| Requirements                                           | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... | ...create a 2d4 Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

Already this is looking jucier. Now, not only do we get a 1d4 bonus to attacks, but we can also spend the dice on the advantage for breaking down doors, resisting mind control, and all kinds of other stuff that having a **Berserking** advantage helps with.

Where do we go from here? Well, a simple route would just be to increase the number of dice that we have on the Berserking advantage to get more Berserking Time, but what if we made it a special advantage? We'd need our gamemaster's approval and their help making some balanced tweaks, but with their help we could come up with something like...

#### Berserking III

| Requirements                                           | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... | ...create a 1d4 Special Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

> **Berserking**
>
> When you **make an attack** add 1d4 to this advantage.
> The first time you **take damage** each turn, add 1d4 to this advantage.
> If you end your turn without spending dice from this advantage, the advantage is lost.

This is what our gamemaster helped us come up with. It's a Special Advantage that feeds itself the more that we attack and take damage, but it has the downside of needing to be used at least once on each of our turns or it goes away. Now we're really getting somewhere! 

But... what if we could make it _even better?_ Our gamemaster has an idea for that-- they say that if we want to, we can upgrade the ability again to remove the restriction that causes us to lose the advantage.

#### Berserking IV

| Requirements                                           | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... | ...create a 1d4 Special Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

> **Berserking**
>
> When you **make an attack** add 1d4 to this advantage.
> The first time you **take damage** each turn, add 1d4 to this advantage.

Wow. We are now three improvements deep into this ability and it feels pretty powerful indeed. By spending just one of our resources, we get a powerful advantage that we can feed off of making attacks and taking damage, like a true berserker might. If we play our cards right, we'll be adding dice front, left, and center all battle long!

<br/>

## Keeping it All "Balanced"

Gamemasters, as you've been reading through this section you're probably wondering if there's some kind of behind-the-scenes mechanic for making a balanced ability. The short answer is: there isn't.

The longer answer is there isn't, but not for a lack of trying. I spent quite some time working out various systems for point-buying your way to "balanced" abilities, but at the end of the day they all ended up being unbalanced in one way or another. After all, if you have an ability that gives you an extra d8 when you attack an undead enemy, how useful that ability is depends entirely on how often the GM pits you against undead enemies. If you have an ability to fly, how useful that ability is depends on how often you need to and couldn't otherwise.

Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities as you go. If an ability feels too strong? Give it an extra requirement, or make one of its requirements more costly! If an ability feels too weak? Give it an extra effect or strengthen one of its existing effects for free.
