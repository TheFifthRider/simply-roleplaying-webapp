# Abilities

**Abilities** are the special things that your character can do, the things that make your character mechanically unique. Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the [weapon](equipment.md#weapon) tag, their unique [power](../extras/powers.md) allows them to do something extraordinary, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details!

## Resources

Consider what drives your character, and what makes them able to do the incredible things they do.

<!-- Create a resource to begin with. Always upgrades? Only ever upgrades on new abilities? -->

## Ability Advancement

For every **10 potential earned** (not spent) choose to either [gain a new ability](#gaining-new-abilities) or [improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities)

## Gaining new Abilities

If you choose to **gain a new ability**, your character learns a new ability. If your GM has a list of abilities for you to choose from, you can choose one of those, or you can create your own.

### Creating an Ability

<!-- Can we name charge something different that represents it as a resource right off the bat? -->

An ability is composed of a **cost** that describes how often you can use it, a **trigger** that describes when it happens, and an **effect** that describes what it does. A finished ability reads something like this: 

| Cost          | Trigger             | Effect                      |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Once per rest | when I attack I can | add an extra d4 to my roll. |

To create a new ability, pick a trigger and an effect. The cost for the ability will be **once per rest**.

<!-- Describe the difficulty of usual tests -->

#### Big Abilities

Some effects are stronger than others. When you have an effect that is clearly stronger than 

#### Creating Abilities with Shared Charge

When you create an ability, you can choose to have it share the same charge as an existing ability. Choose an ability that you already have, increase the charge of the existing ability by one, and add a new trigger and effect to represent the new ability. 

Once an ability has more than two or three charges, it is likely that the ability represents a core gameplay mechanic for your character. Consider naming the charges as a resource of some kind-- about what they're drawing upon to perform this ability and come up with a name for a resource that can be used to represent the charges.

<!-- Points example -->

#### Creating Passive Abilities

Not all abilities need to be limited by how often they can be used, like a martial artist's natural ability to use their fists as a [weapon](equipment.md#Weapon). If it doesn't always make sense for an ability to have a charge, talk to your gamemaster about making the ability a **passive ability**.

Passive abilities are simply abilities which do not have charge. Gamemasters and players should expect to workshop passive abilities more than active abilities. In addition, consider adding additional triggers that all must be satisfied to use the effect, or weakening the effect compared to an ability with a charge.

### Example Triggers and Effects

Here are a few examples of triggers and effects to get you started.

| Trigger                                                      | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| When I'm in a specific situation I can...                    | ...increase 1 target's Armor Value by 1d4 until the end of their next turn. |
| When I use equipment with a specific tag I can...            | ...give 1 target a 1d4 advantage until the end of their next turn. |
| I can spend an action to...                                  | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll.                              |
| When I do something related to a specific background I can... | ...roll 1d4 and recover that much damage.                    |
| When I take a specific action I can...                       | ...give a specific equipment a specific tag until the end of my next turn. |
| When I make a specific test I can...                         | ...move up to my speed.                                      |
|                                                              | ...do something extraordinary.                               |
|                                                              | ...get a specific equipment with specific tags until the end of my next turn. |
|                                                              | ...move a target up to my speed.                             |
|                                                              | ...perform a specific action.                                |
|                                                              | ...remove a specific type of disadvantage from yourself.     |
|                                                              | ...reroll the dice for a test.                               |
|                                                              | ...give 1 target a 1d4 disadvantage until the end of their next turn. |

## Improving Existing Abilities

If you choose to **improve an existing ability**, you can either give an ability an extra effect or strengthen that ability in some way.

### Giving an Ability an Additional Effect

Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. Adding an extra effect to an existing ability is fairly straightforward-- simply choose a new effect and add it to your ability's existing trigger. The strength of the effect should be comparable to or less than the strength of the initial effect for the ability.

### Making an Ability Stronger

If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. Generally, this amplification can be done by increasing the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broadening the situations in which the ability can apply. Here are some effects and how you might strengthen them:

| Effect                                                       | Ways you could strengthen it                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ...do something extraordinary.                               | Increase the magnitude of the extraordinary action.          |
| ...increase 1 target's Armor Value by 1d4 for a specific amount of time. | Increase the number of targets<br/>Replace targets with an area of effect<br/>increase the amount of time |
| ...give 1 target 1d4 that they can use to perform a specific action. They lose this die after a specific amount of time. | Increase the number of targets<br/>Replace targets with an area of effect<br/>Add an additional action they could perform<br/>Increase the amount of time |
| ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll.                              |                                                              |
| ...recover from an injury.                                   |                                                              |
| ...roll 1d4 and recover that much damage.                    |                                                              |
| ...move up to my speed.                                      |                                                              |
| ...give a specific equipment a specific tag for a specific amount of time. | Add additional tags<br/>Add equipment that could be used<br/>Increase the amount of time |
| ...get a specific equipment with specific tags for a specific amount of time. | Add additional tags<br/>Increase the amount of time          |



## How Abilities Scale

At certain numbered milestones, dice increase and equipment granted by abilities become more powerful.

| Milestones | Die  | Modifier |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- |
| 0          | 1d4  | +0       |
| 1          | 1d4  | +1       |
| 2          | 1d6  | +2       |
| 3          | 1d6  | +3       |
| 4          | 1d8  | +4       |
| 5          | 1d8  | +5       |
| 6          | 1d10 | +6       |
| 7          | 1d10 | +7       |
| 8          | 1d12 | +8       |
