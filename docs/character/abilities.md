# Abilities

**Abilities** are the special things that your character can do, the things that make your character mechanically unique. Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the [weapon](equipment.md#weapon) tag, their unique [power](../extras/powers.md) allows them to do something extraordinary, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details!

For every **10 potential earned** (not spent) choose to either [gain a new ability](#gaining-new-abilities) or [improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities)

## Gaining new Abilities

If you choose to **gain a new ability**, your character learns a new ability. If your GM has a list of abilities for you to choose from, you can choose one of those, or you can create your own.

### Creating an Ability

An ability is composed of a **charge** that describes how often you can use it, a **trigger** that describes when it happens, and an **effect** that describes what it does. A finished ability reads something like this: 

| Charge        | Trigger             | Effect                      |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Once per rest | when I attack I can | add an extra d4 to my roll. |

To create a new ability, pick a trigger and an effect. The charge for the ability will be **once per rest**.

#### Creating another Ability that shares Charge

Sometimes when you create an ability, you'll want it to share the same charge as an existing ability. This is particularly helpful when you want some flexibility in how you can use your abilities. In that case, increase the charge of the existing ability by one and add a new trigger and effect as normal. It may be useful to come up with a name for the shared pool of charge and to treat it like a resource.

#### Creating Passive Abilities

Not all abilities need to be limited by how often they can be used, like a martial artist's natural ability to use their fists as a [weapon](equipment.md#Weapon). If it doesn't always make sense for an ability to have a charge, talk to your gamemaster about making the ability a **passive ability**. Passive abilities do not have charge, and cannot gain charge from [improvements](#Improving-Existing-Abilities)-- however because they are always active, it can be tricky to balance them. Gamemasters and players should expect to workshop passive abilities more than active abilities. In addition, consider adding additional triggers that all must be satisfied to use the effect, or weakening the effect compared to an ability with a charge.

### Example Triggers and Effects

Here are a few examples of triggers and effects to get you started. Not all of the triggers or effects listed here are created equal. You can look to your gamemaster for guidance on what abilities are balanced combinations.

| Trigger                                                      | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| When I'm in a specific situation I can...                    | ...do something extraordinary.                               |
| I can spend (1, 2, 3, ... ) actions to...                    | ...increase 1 target's Armor Value by 1d4 for a specific amount of time. |
| I can spend downtime to...                                   | ...give 1 target 1d4 that they can use to perform a specific action. They lose this die after a specific amount of time. |
| When I use equipment with a specific tag I can...            | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll.                              |
| When I do something related to a specific background I can... | ...recover from an injury.                                   |
| When I take a specific action I can...                       | ...roll 1d4 and recover that much damage.                    |
| When I make a specific test I can...                         | ...move up to my speed.                                      |
|                                                              | ...give a specific equipment a specific tag for a specific amount of time. |
|                                                              | ...get a specific equipment with specific tags for a specific amount of time. |

### Example Abilities

Here are a few example abilities created using the triggers and effects listed above:

#### Reinforce Armor

| Charge | Trigger | Effect |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| Once per rest, | I can spend downtime to... | ...increase 1 target's Armor Value by 1d4 for the next scene |

#### Target Vitals

| Charge         | Trigger                                 | Effect                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Once per rest, | When I'm hidden from my target I can... | ...make attacks as though my weapons had the **intuition** tag until the end of my turn. |

#### I've Read That

| Charge         | Trigger                              | Effect                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Once per rest, | When I research information I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. |

#### Shrug It Off

| Charge         | Trigger                     | Effect                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Once per rest, | I can spend 2 actions to... | ...recover from an injury. |

#### Everything is a Weapon in my Hands

| Charge         | Trigger                                                  | Effect                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Once per rest, | When I'm holding equipment without the **weapon** tag... | ...I can give it the **weapon** tag for the scene. _(The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one)_ |



## Improving Existing Abilities

If you choose to **improve an existing ability**, you can either give an ability an extra effect or strengthen that ability in some way.

### Giving an Ability an Additional Effect

Adding an extra effect to an existing ability is fairly straightforward. Simply choose a new effect and add it to your ability's existing trigger. The strength of the effect should be comparable to or less than the strength of the initial effect for the ability.

### Making an Ability Stronger

Strengthening an ability is all about amplifying its effects. Here are some examples of ways you could strengthen an ability:

| Effect                                                       | Ways you could strengthen it                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ...do something extraordinary.                               | Increase the magnitude of the extraordinary action.          |
| ...increase 1 target's Armor Value by 1d4 for a specific amount of time. | Increase the number of targets<br/>Replace targets with an area of effect<br/>increase the amount of time |
| ...give 1 target 1d4 that they can use to perform a specific action. They lose this die after a specific amount of time. | Increase the number of targets<br/>Replace targets with an area of effect<br/>Add an additional action they could perform<br/>Increase the amount of time |
| ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll.                              |                                                              |
| ...recover from an injury.                                   |                                                              |
| ...roll 1d4 and recover that much damage.                    |                                                              |
| ...move up to my speed.                                      |                                                              |
| ...give a specific equipment a specific tag for a specific amount of time. | Add additional tags<br/>Add equipment that could be used<br/>Increase the amount of time |
| ...get a specific equipment with specific tags for a specific amount of time. | Add additional tags<br/>Increase the amount of time          |



## How Abilities Scale

At certain numbered milestones, dice increase and equipment granted by abilities become more powerful.

| 0          | 1d4  | +0       |

| 2          | 1d6  | +2       |
| 3          | 1d6  | +3       |
| 4          | 1d8  | +4       |
| 5          | 1d8  | +5       |
| 6          | 1d10 | +6       |
| 7          | 1d10 | +7       |
| 8          | 1d12 | +8       |
