# Abilities

**Abilities** are your special moves. They're your magic spells, martial art forms, animal transformations, or any other cool mechanic that's specific to your character. And best of all? You decide how they work.

## Ability Points

To start with, consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do? An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! 

Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of **ability points**. If you're not sure, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later-- but it is a good idea to come up with a name for them later. It helps to make the flavor of your character come to life!

You start with a pool of **2** of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you [spend some downtime to recover](../gameplay/downtime.md#recovering). 

You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their _mana_ from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their _ammunition_ in an arsenal.  A leader might replenish their _pride_ from cheering throngs of admirers.

## Gaining Ability Points and Creating Abilities

Every **10 potential you earn** (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two.

Any number of times between sessions you can reduce your maximum ability points by **1** to [learn a new ability](#creating-an-ability), or reduce your maximum ability points by **2** to [improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities). If you happen to have multiple pools of ability points you may reduce any one of them by **1** to learn a new ability, or **2** to improve an existing ability. You can also reduce two of them by **1** to improve an existing ability.

Similarly, between sessions you can remove abilities from your character sheet if you feel like they don't belong-- whether you just don't like how they work or if you feel like they don't make sense to your character anymore. If you do, make sure you increase your maximum ability points to compensate for the points you spent to earn that ability.

If you made up new abilities or improvements, it's a good idea to make sure you take some time to talk them over with your table and/or your GM before you introduce them.

### Advanced Actions

One of the easiest ways to create an ability is to power up a [basic action](../gameplay/basic_actions.md) into something more advanced. For instance...

#### Special Attack

> <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **Fireball**
> 
> As an action by spending 1 _mp_, make an attack against a target within long range, and all targets within short range of them.

#### Special Defend

> <i class="fa-solid fa-shield"></i> **Dodge and Roll**
> 
> When you defend against an attack, you can spend 1 point of _slickness_ to move 1 space away from the person who attacked you. If you critically succeed, you can move half your speed instead.

#### Special Get Answers

> <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> **The Dead Speak to Me**
> 
> You can spend 1 _runed bone_ to roll Presence and Get Answers by speaking with the spirits of the recently departed as long as you have a remnant of them or something they cared about.

#### Special Help

> <i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Amythest Ward**
> 
> By spending 1 _magical gem_, you can roll Knowledge to Help yourself or any ally within short range by erecting a shimmering purple barrier that wards off attacks. 

#### Special Hinder

><i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Flashbang Grenade**
>
>By spending 1 _ammunition_, you can roll Intuition to Hinder a target within short range by firing a flashbang from your shoulder cannon.

#### Special Make Progress (On Something Big)

><i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> **Words of Inspiration**
>
>By spending 1 point of _ridiculous charisma_ you can roll Presence to Make Progress on something you wouldn't normally be able to help with by inspiring someone else who is doing it.

#### Special Prepare

><i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> **Ready for Anything**
>
>By spending 1 _scrappiness_, you can roll Intuition in the minutes before a fight to Prepare for a battle with an enemy, flashing back to any tricks you may have hidden up your sleeve.

#### Special Test

> <i class="ra ra-diamonds-card"></i> **Mechanisms are My Forte**
> 
> By spending 1 point of _never unprepared_ before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade a d12 to a d20 before rolling.

### New Actions

Another way to create abilities is to make entirely new actions! Abilities can do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway.

#### Heal Somebody
Test a specific attribute, then heal damage from someone [close](../getting_started/index.md#range-and-spaces) equal to what you rolled.  If you roll higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes.

Upgrade suggestions:
 * Increase the level at which you heal
 * Increase the [range](../getting_started/index.md#range-and-spaces) at which you can heal

> **Medic Matrix**
> As an action by spending 1 *nyanobot*, test your knowledge to heal that much damage from someone close. If you rolled higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes.

#### Automatic Equipment
Give yourself equipment for the scene, or treat parts of yourself as if they were equipment.

Equipment becomes +1 at level 2, +2 at level 3, up to +9 at level 10.

Upgrade suggestions:
* Give your equipment additional tags

> **Rockin' Abs**
> As a reaction, you can spend 1 _muscle point_ to treat your 6 pack as if it was equipment with the _brawn_ and _armor_ tags for the scene.

Temporarily give yourself equipment, use equipment you have at a different level, or give equipment a specific tag.

#### Special Movement
Ignore terrain restrictions to get where you want to go.

Upgrade suggestions:
* Increase the range for your movement ❔

> **Skybound**
> As an action, by spending 1 point of _heroic strength_, leap to any space within ten spaces.

#### Move an Enemy
Test a specific attribute against an enemy's passive attribute to move them where you want them!

Upgrade suggestions:
* Increase the range for your grapple ❔

> **Grapple Gun**
> As an action, fire your grappling hook arm at an enemy within long range to pull them in closer. Test your brawn against their passive agility and pull them....
> **Partial Success:** in a straight line a short range
> **Full Success:** in a straight line a medium range
> **Critical Success:** to any space within close range of you

## Upgrading Abilities

As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either **give them an extra effect** or **make them stronger**.

### Giving an Ability an Additional Effect

Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. If an ability turned one d12 into a d20 when Getting Answers about a monster, giving it an extra effect might allow you to Help yourself at the same time, creating a [stack](../gameplay/stacks.md) named _I know_ [monster name]_'s strengths and weaknesses_ with the same roll.

If an ability allowed you to give equipment the _blessed_ and _weapon_ tags, adding an extra effect might let you make a test of _presence_ to heal the wielder too!

### Making an Ability Stronger

If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. If an ability would push a target away from you, a stronger version of the ability might be able to push everyone within a _close range_ of you away instead. If an ability would grant you an extra _d4_ when wielding weapons tagged with _cleaving_, a strengthened version of the ability might give you an extra _d4_ with _cleaving_ or _hooking_-tagged _weapons_. Stronger abilities typically increase the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broaden the situations in which an ability might apply.
