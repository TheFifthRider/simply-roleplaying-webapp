# Abilities

**Abilities** are the special things that your character can do, the things that make your character mechanically unique. Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the [weapon](equipment.md#weapon) tag, their unique [power](../extras/powers.md) allows them to do something extraordinary, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details!

## What makes an Ability?

An ability has a **trigger** that describes when it happens, and an **effect** that describes what it does. Many abilities also have a **cost** to activate them. A finished ability reads something like this: 

| Cost                        | Trigger             | Effect                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| By spending 1 ability point | when I attack I can | add an extra d4 to my roll. |

<br/>

## Ability Advancement

For every **10 potential earned** (not spent) choose to either [gain a new ability](#gaining-new-abilities) or [improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities)

<br/>

## Gaining new Abilities

If you choose to **gain a new ability**, your character learns a new ability. If your GM has a list of abilities for you to choose from, you can choose one of those, or you can [create your own](#creating-an-ability). 

<br/>

## Improving Existing Abilities

If you choose to **improve an existing ability**, you can either give an ability an extra effect or strengthen that ability in some way.

### Giving an Ability an Additional Effect

Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. Adding an extra effect to an existing ability is fairly straightforward-- simply choose a new effect and add it to your ability's existing trigger. The strength of the effect should be comparable to or less than the strength of the initial effect for the ability.

### Making an Ability Stronger

If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. Generally, this amplification can be done by increasing the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broadening the situations in which the ability can apply. Here are some effects and how you might strengthen them:

| Effect                                                       | Ways you could strengthen it                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ...do something extraordinary.                               | Increase the magnitude of the extraordinary action.          |
| ...increase 1 target's Armor Value by 1d4 for a specific amount of time. | Increase the number of targets<br/>Replace targets with an area of effect<br/>increase the amount of time |
| ...give 1 target 1d4 that they can use to perform a specific action. They lose this die after a specific amount of time. | Increase the number of targets<br/>Replace targets with an area of effect<br/>Add an additional action they could perform<br/>Increase the amount of time |
| ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll.                              | Create a 2d4 advantage that you can use immediately          |
| ...make a test and recover that much damage.                 |                                                              |
| ...move up to my speed.                                      |                                                              |
| ...give a specific equipment a specific tag for a specific amount of time. | Add additional tags<br/>Add equipment that could be used<br/>Increase the amount of time |
| ...get a specific equipment with specific tags for a specific amount of time. | Add additional tags<br/>Increase the amount of time          |

<br/>

## How Abilities Scale

At certain numbered milestones, dice increase and equipment granted by abilities become more powerful.

| Milestones | Die  | Modifier |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- |
| 0          | 1d4  | +0       |
| 1          | 1d4  | +1       |
| 2          | 1d6  | +2       |
| 3          | 1d6  | +3       |
| 4          | 1d8  | +4       |
| 5          | 1d8  | +5       |
| 6          | 1d10 | +6       |
| 7          | 1d10 | +7       |
| 8          | 1d12 | +8       |
| 9+         | 1d12 | +9       |

# Creating an Ability

[Abilities](abilities.md) consist of a **cost** a **trigger** and an **effect**. To create a new ability, you need to create one of each of these.

## Costs and Ability Points

Many abilities have a **cost** that limit how often they can be used. An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, or even simply tire the character using them by depleting their mana, chi, or other source of energy. This is a chance to personalize how your character plays, so consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do?

Whatever it is, that their type of **ability points**. If you can't think of one, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later. You start with a pool of two of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you [spend some downtime to recover](../gameplay/downtime.md#recovering) or when it makes sense that you would.

### Creating Multiple types of Ability Points

Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their _mana_ to use abilities related to their magic power might also have _flourishes_ that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both _ammunition_ for their arsenal of weapons and _psi points_. An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each attached to different inventions.

You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you may choose **one** of the types of ability points that you have to increase.

<br/>

## Other Costs

Spending ability points is often the simplest way to give abilities a cost, but not every ability needs to spend ability points. Some abilities to have an alternate cost such as time, money, or damage. Some might have no cost at all. Some particularly powerful or permanent abilities might combine an alternate cost with the cost of the ability points.

### Alternate or Additional Costs

Your GM may say that some abilities require additional costs beyond your initial abilities. This is especially true of abilities that permanently create or enhance things like [equipment](equipment.md), which often have monetary costs associated with the materials, tools, and space needed to perform the enhancement. 

Sometimes the cost of an ability is time. The space station might need to spend multiple turns worth of actions charging its _Planet-Destroying Laser_, or an _Dragonbreath Cannon_ might need a scene to cool down once it's been used. 

These costs may replace the ability point cost, or may be in addition to the ability point cost depending on what makes sense.

### Passive Abilities: Abilities with No Cost

Not all abilities need to be limited by how often they can be used, like a martial artist's natural ability to use their fists as a [weapon](equipment.md#Weapon). If it doesn't always make sense for an ability to have a charge, talk to your gamemaster about making the ability a **passive ability**.

Passive abilities are simply abilities which do not have charge. Gamemasters and players should expect to workshop passive abilities more than active abilities. In addition, consider adding additional triggers that all must be satisfied to use the effect, or weakening the effect compared to an ability with a cost.

<br/>

## Customizing Ability Points

If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it.

If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities.

## Triggers and Effects

Here are a few examples of triggers and effects to get you started.

| Trigger                                                      | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

|                                                              | ...do something extraordinary.                               |
|                                                              | ...get a specific equipment with specific tags until the end of my next turn. |
|                                                              | ...move a target up to my speed.                             |
|                                                              | ...perform a specific action.                                |
|                                                              | ...remove a specific type of disadvantage from yourself.     |
|                                                              | ...reroll the dice for a test.                               |
|                                                              | ...give 1 target a 1d4 disadvantage until the end of their next turn. |

<br/>

## Example of Making an Ability Stronger

Here's a more in-detail example of how one could make an ability stronger.

Let's start with the ability **Berserking**

#### Berserking

| Cost                         | Trigger                            | Effect                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| By spending a point of fury, | When I make an **attack** I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. |

A good starting point, but let's see if we can make it more interesting.

The next chance we get to improve abilities, we choose to **make the ability stronger**. We can't increase the number of dice that we have, but we can change the dice into an **advantage** that can be used more than once. Since advantages are more broadly useful than just attacks, let's also change the trigger to an action.

#### Berserking II

| Cost                         | Trigger                     | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, | I can spend an action to... | ...create a 2d4 Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

Already this is looking jucier. Now, not only do we get a 1d4 bonus to attacks, but we can also spend the dice on the advantage for breaking down doors, resisting mind control, and all kinds of other stuff that having a **Berserking** advantage helps with.

Where do we go from here? Well, a simple route would just be to increase the number of dice that we have on the Berserking advantage to get more Berserking Time, but what if we made it a special advantage? We'd need our gamemaster's approval and their help making some balanced tweaks, but with their help we could come up with something like...

#### Berserking III

| Cost                         | Trigger                     | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, | I can spend an action to... | ...create a 1d4 Special Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

> **Berserking**
>
> When you **make an attack** add 1d4 to this advantage.
> The first time you **take damage** each turn, add 1d4 to this advantage.
> If you end your turn without spending dice from this advantage, the advantage is lost.

This is what our gamemaster helped us come up with. It's a Special Advantage that feeds itself the more that we attack and take damage, but it has the downside of needing to be used at least once on each of our turns or it goes away. Now we're really getting somewhere! 

But... what if we could make it _even better?_ Our gamemaster has an idea for that-- they say that if we want to, we can upgrade the ability again to remove the restriction that causes us to lose the advantage.

#### Berserking IV

| Cost                         | Trigger                     | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, | I can spend an action to... | ...create a 1d4 Special Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

> **Berserking**
>
> When you **make an attack** add 1d4 to this advantage.
> The first time you **take damage** each turn, add 1d4 to this advantage.

Wow. We are now three improvements deep into this ability and it feels pretty powerful indeed. By spending just one of our resources, we get a powerful advantage that we can feed off of making attacks and taking damage, like a true berserker might. If we play our cards right, we'll be adding dice front, left, and center all battle long!
