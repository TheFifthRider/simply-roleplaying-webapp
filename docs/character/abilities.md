# Abilities

**Abilities** are the cool mechanics that show off what makes your character awesome. Maybe their extensive martial arts training allows them to use their fists as though they were equipment with the [weapon](equipment.md#weapon) tag, their [power](../extras/powers.md) over gravity allows them to temporarily lift massive objects, or they are just inhumanly good at remembering details!

This section is written assuming that players and GMs will work together to create cool abilities, but you can also o decide to create and curate a list of abilities that characters are able to choose from and that's a fine way to play too! That's the way most TTRPGs work, after all.

<br/>

## What do Abilities do?

Abilities do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway.

Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them. If you want to make an ability called *Godmode* that *makes you immortal.* Go for it. Just make sure you check with your GM and the rest of the table-- they may not want to play a TTRPG where somebody has cheat codes on. Of course, that's not to say nobody would. Overpowered characters who can completely change the world have lots of interesting dramatic potential. As long as everyone is having fun, that's what matters.

### Ok, but what do they usually do?

Often, a character's abilities will do things like:

*   Do something narratively extraordinary
*   Move the character where they want to be
*   Move someone else where the character wants them to be
*   Give some [equipment](equipment.md) a specific [tag](equipment.md#the-full-list-of-tags)
*   Allow someone to do something as if they had equipment with a specific [tag](equipment.md#the-full-list-of-tags)
*   Make a test to heal [damage](damage_and_injuries.md)
*   Deal [damage](damage_and_injuries.md)
*   Create an [advantage or disadvantage](../gameplay/advantages_and_disadvantages.md)
    *   ...which could be a [special advantage or disadvantage](../gameplay/advantages_and_disadvantages.md#Special Advantages and Disadvantages)

If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a [Test of Ability](../gameplay/tests.md) to resist the effects, setting the **Difficulty** and describing what happens if they Critically Succeed, Succeed, Partially Succeed, or Fail.

### What do they look like?

Usually an ability has a **trigger** that describes when it happens and an **effect** that describes what it does. Many abilities also have a **cost** to activate them. A finished ability reads something like this: 

| Cost                        | Trigger       | Effect                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| By spending 1 ability point | when I attack | I can light my sword on fire to add an extra d4 damage. |

<br/>

## Costs and Ability Points

A **cost** limits how often an ability can be used. An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, or a source of energy like mana. This is a chance to personalize how your character plays, so consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do?

Whatever it is, that their type of **ability points**. If you can't think of one, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later. You start with a pool of two of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you [spend some downtime to recover](../gameplay/downtime.md#recovering).

You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their _mana_ from leylines. A might be able to replenish their _ammunition_ in an arsenal.  A leader might replenish their _pride_ from cheering throngs of admirers.

### Creating Multiple types of Ability Points

Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their _mana_ to use abilities related to their magic power might also have _flourishes_ that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both _ammunition_ for their arsenal of weapons and _psi points_. An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions.

You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you only gain that many ability points in total-- you must choose which of your types of ability points increase.

### Customizing Ability Points

If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it.

If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities.

<br/>

## Upgrading Abilities

As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either **give them an extra effect** or **make them stronger**.

### Giving an Ability an Additional Effect

Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. If an ability gave you an extra die, giving it an extra effect might allow you to create an [advantage][../gameplay/advantages_and_disadvantages.md] as well. If an ability allowed you to give equipment a tag, adding an extra effect might let you heal the wielder too!

### Making an Ability Stronger

If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. If an ability would pushing a character away from you, a stronger version of the ability might be able to push everyone within a **close range** of you instead. If an ability would grant you an extra die when wielding **weapons** tagged with **cleaving**, a strengthened version of the ability might give you that bonus with **cleaving** or **hooking**-tagged **weapons**. Stronger abilities typically increase the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broaden the situations in which an ability might apply.

<br/>

## When do you get or improve Abilities?

You earn new abilities and upgrade existing abilities by earning [potential](milestones.md). Every **10 potential you earn** (spent or not) you get to choose one of the following:

* Increase your [ability points](#costs-and-ability-points) by two
* [Get a new ability](#creating-an-ability) and increase your [ability points](#costs-and-ability-points) by one
* [Get two new abilities](#creating-an-ability)
* [Improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities)

<br/>

## Abilities Growing with Milestones

When making an ability, you may not want all aspects of the ability to be improved by a player choosing to **improve an ability**. Things like difficulties for tests, the size of bonus dice, and the **+X** tag on ability-created equipment aren't things that feel rewarding to level up-- improving an ability should feel exactly like that-- an improvement. It should never feel like keeping up.

To that end, use Milestones to gauge when an ability's power grows. Bonus dice granted by an ability, for example, might start as d4s at Milestone 0 and increase every two milestones until Milestone 8, when they become d12s. Here are some more suggestions!

| Milestones | Die  | Equipment Quality | Test difficulty |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------------- | ------- |
| 0          | 1d4  | +0                |10|
| 1          | 1d4  | +1                |15|
| 2          | 1d6  | +2                |20|
| 3          | 1d6  | +3                |25|
| 4          | 1d8  | +4                |30|
| 5          | 1d8  | +5                |35|
| 6          | 1d10 | +6                |40|
| 7          | 1d10 | +7                |45|
| 8          | 1d12 | +8                |50|
| 9+         | 1d12 | +9                |55|

## Let's Make Some Abilities

All right, we've spent enough time talking about how they work. Let's make some ability points and an ability to use them.

### Tinkering Inventor

What if our character was a _Tinkering Inventor_? Someone who can always make the right tools for the job. Their abilities could be the inventions they create, powered by the **scrap** that the Inventor uses to make them. One ability could be **Springloaded Boots**-- a cobbled together contraption that allows the wearer to leap further and run faster... until it breaks. That's pretty easy to represent as an advantage that the Inventor puts together over some downtime.

Ability points: **Scrap**
Ability: **Springloaded Boots**

| Cost                 | Trigger                    | Effect                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| By spending 1 scrap, | I can spend downtime to... | ...give 1 target a 4d4 advantage called Springloaded Boots. |

And upgrading it would probably mean making the boots last longer and be more durable, so we can just increase the number of dice on the advantage

| Cost                 | Trigger                    | Effect                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending 1 scrap, | I can spend downtime to... | ...give 1 target an **8**d4 advantage called Springloaded Boots. |

<br/>

### Alchemist

What if our character was an _Alchemist_ who produced poisons and potions? Their abilities could be the various potions effects they know how to make, powered by the **concoctions** that the Alchemist brews when the party rests. One ability could be a **Health Potion** that heals a bit of damage.

Ability points: **Concoctions**
Ability: **Health Potion**

| Cost                      | Trigger                     | Effect                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| By spending 1 concoction, | I can spend an action to... | ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach. |

We could then upgrade this potion to give it a secondary effect-- perhaps an invigorating advantage?

| Cost                      | Trigger                     | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending 1 concoction, | I can spend an action to... | ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach and give them a 2d4 advantage called _Invigorated_. |

<br/>

### Unassuming Assassin

What if our character was an _Unassuming Assassin_? Someone small or frail who nonetheless is a lethal threat. Their abilities could be powered by their ability to mentally note their enemy's weak spots with **assassin's marks**. One ability could be **Strike Their Weaknesses**-- a technique to make attacks with anything based on intuitive analysis rather than strength or speed.

Ability points: **Assassin's Marks**
Ability: **Strike Their Weaknesses**

| Cost                            | Trigger                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending an assassin's mark, | When I'm hidden from my target I can... | ...make attacks as though my weapons had the **intuition** tag until the end of my turn. |

Upgrading this ability might allow us to add another tag, maybe the _concealable_ tag.

| Cost                            | Trigger                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending an assassin's mark, | When I'm hidden from my target I can... | ...make attacks as though my weapons had the **intuition** and **concealable** tags until the end of my turn. |

<br/>

### Internet Savant

What if our character was an _Internet Savant_ who mastered the art of utilizing the collective human knowledge present on the web? Their abilities could be powered by their **cellular data**. A core ability of theirs could be **There's a Wiki for That**, because of course there is.

Ability points: **Cellular Data**
Ability: **There's a Wiki for That**

| Cost                                  | Trigger                                                     | Effect                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| By spending a point of cellular data, | When I spend some downtime to research information I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. |

Upgrading this ability might allow the Savant to utilize some tidbits they picked up when researching as an advantage.

| Cost                                  | Trigger                                                     | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of cellular data, | When I spend some downtime to research information I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll and give myself an appropriately titled 4d4 advantage based on what I researched. |

<br/>

### Street Brawler

What if our character was a _Street Brawler_ who was used to using anything at their disposal in a scrap? Their abilities could be powered by their **reputation** as a fighter. An ability of theirs could be **Everything's a Weapon in My Hands**, letting them improvise weapons from whatever they can grab.

Ability points: **Reputation**
Ability: **Everything's a Weapon in My Hands**

| Cost                               | Trigger                                                | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of reputation, | When I'm using equipment without the **weapon** tag... | ...I can give it the **weapon** tag for the scene. _(The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one)_ |

Upgrading this ability could make those weapons more lethal by giving them an extra tag.

| Cost                               | Trigger                                                | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of reputation, | When I'm using equipment without the **weapon** tag... | ...I can give it the **weapon** tag for the scene. It also gets the **+1** tag if it isn't already tagged with a bigger **+X** tag. _(The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one)_ |

<br/>

## Improving an Ability Throughout a Campaign

Here's a more in-detail example of how one could make an ability stronger over the course of multiple enhancements.

Let's start with the ability **Berserking**

#### Berserking

| Cost                         | Trigger                            | Effect                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| By spending a point of fury, | When I make an **attack** I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. |

A good starting point, but let's see if we can make it more interesting.

The next chance we get to improve abilities, we choose to **make the ability stronger**. We can't increase the number of dice that we have, but we can change the dice into an **advantage** that can be used more than once. Since advantages are more broadly useful than just attacks, let's also change the trigger to an action.

#### Berserking II

| Cost                         | Trigger                     | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, | I can spend an action to... | ...create a 2d4 Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

Already this is looking jucier. Now, not only do we get a 1d4 bonus to attacks, but we can also spend the dice on the advantage for breaking down doors, resisting mind control, and all kinds of other stuff that having a **Berserking** advantage helps with.

Where do we go from here? Well, a simple route would just be to increase the number of dice that we have on the Berserking advantage to get more Berserking Time, but what if we made it a special advantage? We'd need our gamemaster's approval and their help making some balanced tweaks, but with their help we could come up with something like...

#### Berserking III

| Cost                         | Trigger                     | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, | I can spend an action to... | ...create a 1d4 Special Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

> **Berserking**
>
> When you **make an attack** add 1d4 to this advantage.
> The first time you **take damage** each turn, add 1d4 to this advantage.
> If you end your turn without spending dice from this advantage, the advantage is lost.

This is what our gamemaster helped us come up with. It's a Special Advantage that feeds itself the more that we attack and take damage, but it has the downside of needing to be used at least once on each of our turns or it goes away. Now we're really getting somewhere! 

But... what if we could make it _even better?_ Our gamemaster has an idea for that-- they say that if we want to, we can upgrade the ability again to remove the restriction that causes us to lose the advantage.

#### Berserking IV

| Cost                         | Trigger                     | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, | I can spend an action to... | ...create a 1d4 Special Advantage named **Berserking** for the scene. |

> **Berserking**
>
> When you **make an attack** add 1d4 to this advantage.
> The first time you **take damage** each turn, add 1d4 to this advantage.

Wow. We are now three improvements deep into this ability and it feels pretty powerful indeed. By spending just one of our resources, we get a powerful advantage that we can feed off of making attacks and taking damage, like a true berserker might. If we play our cards right, we'll be adding dice front, left, and center all battle long!
