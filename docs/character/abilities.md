# Abilities

**Abilities** are your special moves. They're your magic spells, martial art forms, animal transformations, or any other cool mechanic that's specific to your character. And best of all? You decide how they work.

## Improve Basic Actions

One of the easiest ways to create an ability is to power up a [basic action](../gameplay/basic_actions.md) into something more advanced. For instance...


### Special Attack

> <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **Fireball**
> 
> As an action by spending 1 _mp_, make an attack against a target within long range, and all targets within short range of them.

### Special Defend

> <i class="fa-solid fa-shield"></i> **Dodge and Roll**
> 
> When you defend against an attack, you can spend 1 point of _slickness_ to move 1 space away from the person who attacked you. If you critically succeed, you can move half your speed instead.

### Special Get Answers

> <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> **The Dead Speak to Me**
> 
> You can spend 1 _runed bone_ to roll Presence and Get Answers by speaking with the spirits of the recently departed as long as you have a remnant of them or something they cared about.

### Special Help

> <i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Amythest Ward**
> 
> By spending 1 _magical gem_, you can roll Knowledge to Help yourself or any ally within short range by erecting a shimmering purple barrier that wards off attacks. 

### Special Hinder

><i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Flashbang Grenade**
>
>By spending 1 _ammunition_, you can roll Intuition to Hinder a target within short range by firing a flashbang from your shoulder cannon.

### Special Make Progress (On Something Big)

><i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> **Words of Inspiration**
>
>By spending 1 point of _ridiculous charisma_ you can roll Presence to Make Progress on something you wouldn't normally be able to help with by inspiring someone else who is doing it.

### Special Prepare

><i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> **Ready for Anything**
>
>By spending 1 _scrappiness_, you can roll Intuition in the minutes before a fight to Prepare for a battle with an enemy, flashing back to any tricks you may have hidden up your sleeve.

### Special Test

> <i class="ra ra-diamonds-card"></i> **Mechanisms are My Forte**
> 
> By spending 1 point of _never unprepared_ before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade a d12 to a d20 before rolling.

## New Actions

Another way to create abilities is to make entirely new actions!

### Heal Somebody
Test a specific attribute, then heal damage from someone [close](../getting_started/index.md#range-and-spaces) equal to what you rolled.  If you roll higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes.

Upgrade suggestions:
 * Increase the level at which you heal
 * Increase the [range](../getting_started/index.md#range-and-spaces) at which you can heal

> **Medic Matrix**
> As an action by spending 1 *nyanobot*, test your knowledge to heal that much damage from someone close. If you rolled higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes.

### Automatic Equipment
Give yourself equipment for the scene, or treat parts of yourself as if they were equipment.

Equipment becomes +1 at level 2, +2 at level 3, up to +9 at level 10.

Upgrade suggestions:
* Give your equipment additional tags

> **Rockin' Abs**
> As a reaction, you can spend 1 _muscle point_ to treat your 6 pack as if it was equipment with the _brawn_ and _armor_ tags for the scene.

Temporarily give yourself equipment, use equipment you have at a different level, or give equipment a specific tag.

### Special Movement
Ignore terrain restrictions to get where you want to go.

Upgrade suggestions:
* Increase the range for your movement ❔

> **Skybound**
> As an action, by spending 1 point of _heroic strength_, leap to any space within ten spaces.

### Move an Enemy
Test a specific attribute against an enemy's passive attribute to move them where you want them!

Upgrade suggestions:
* Increase the range for your grapple ❔

> **Grapple Gun**
> As an action, fire your grappling hook arm at an enemy within long range to pull them in closer. Test your brawn against their passive agility and pull them....
> **Partial Success:** in a straight line a short range
> **Full Success:** in a straight line a medium range
> **Critical Success:** to any space within close range of you

## What do Abilities do?

Abilities do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway.

Abilities tend to work best when you don't try to put restrictions on them. If you want to make an ability called *Godmode* that *makes you immortal.* Go for it. Just make sure you check with your GM and the rest of the table-- they may not want to play a TTRPG where somebody has cheat codes on. Of course, that's not to say that characters shouldn't be overpowered! Protagonists with the ability to shape the world to their whim can create a compelling story. Just make sure that everyone is on the same page and having fun, that's what matters.

### Ok, but what do they usually do?

Often, a character's abilities will do things like:

*   Inflict [damage](health.md)
*   Make a test to heal [damage](health.md)
*   Create [dice stacks](../gameplay/stacks.md)
    *   ...which could be [special stacks](../gameplay/stacks.md#special-stacks)
*   Give some [equipment](equipment.md) a specific [tag](equipment.md#the-full-list-of-tags)
*   Allow someone to do something as if they had equipment with a specific [tag](equipment.md#the-full-list-of-tags)
*   Move the character where they want to be
*   Move someone else where the character wants them to be
*   Do something narratively extraordinary (for instance, using [powers](../setting_rules/powers.md))

If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a [Test of Ability](../gameplay/tests.md) to resist the effects, setting the **Difficulty** and describing what happens if they **Critically Succeed**, **Succeed**, **Partially Succeed**, or **Fail**.

## Requirements

Every ability has **requirements** that must be met for you to be able to use it. The more requirements an ability has, or the more costly the requirements, the more powerful the ability should be. Often, requirements will be things like:

* Wielding a specific tool, like being required to _use weapons specific to your art_ to use a martial arts technique
* Being in a specific situation, like being required to be _defending against a melee attack_ to perform a counter
* Taking a specific amount of time, like being required to _spend some downtime_ to create a potion
* Fulfilling a specific narrative goal, like being required to _memorize a character's mannerisms_ to disguise yourself as them
* Spending a specific resource, like being required to _spend mana_ to cast a spell (usually, spending ability points)

### Optional Requirements

You can make an ability more flexible by making it stronger if more requirements are met. These **optional requirements** are often things like spending extra ability points, taking additional time, or fulfilling an extra goal. For instance:

>   **Craft a Disguise**
>   If you've spent at least one period of downtime every day for the last seven days observing a character, you can disguise yourself as that character. You automatically pass as them visually and at a distance.<br/>_If you've spent at least two periods of downtime each day observing them,_ you better understand their mannerisms. You automatically pass as them when interacting with all but their closest friends.

## Ability Points

Consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do?  An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of **ability points**. If you're not sure, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later-- but it is a good idea to come up with a name for them later. It helps to make the flavor of your character come to life!

You start with a pool of **2** of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you [spend some downtime to recover](../gameplay/downtime.md#recovering). You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their _mana_ from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their _ammunition_ in an arsenal.  A leader might replenish their _pride_ from cheering throngs of admirers.

### Creating Multiple types of Ability Points

Characters don't necessarily have one source of powers. A magical blade fighter that uses their _mana_ to use abilities related to their magic power might also have _flourishes_ that they use to perform abilities related to their sword mastery. A cyborg psychic might have both _ammunition_ for their arsenal of weapons and _psi points_. An inventor may have any number of different ability points, each representative of their different inventions.

You can give your character an additional type of ability points whenever you would increase the number of ability points you have. Instead of increasing the number of ability points you have, just create a new pool of two ability points of the new type. When you can increase the number of ability points you have, you only gain that many ability points in total-- you must choose which of your types of ability points increase.

### Customizing Ability Points

If you're feeling particularly creative, you may want your abilities to be powered by something other than a pool of points. They could be powered by a pool of dice, a set of leveled slots, or a deck of cards that does something different depending on what card you draw. If you or your GM have a creative idea for how you want to power your character's abilities, go for it.

If you choose to do so, keep in mind the capability of characters with ability point pools. A character with a deck of cards that do different things likely shouldn't start with more than two cards, and should gain additional cards or improve existing cards in a way similar to how a character with ability points would gain additional points in their pool and improve their existing abilities.

## Gaining Ability Points and Creating Abilities

Every **10 potential you earn** (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two.

Any number of times between sessions you can reduce your maximum ability points by **1** to [learn a new ability](#creating-an-ability), or reduce your maximum ability points by **2** to [improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities). If you happen to have multiple pools of ability points you may reduce any one of them by **1** to learn a new ability, or **2** to improve an existing ability. You can also reduce two of them by **1** to improve an existing ability.

Similarly, between sessions you can remove abilities from your character sheet if you feel like they don't belong-- whether you just don't like how they work or if you feel like they don't make sense to your character anymore. If you do, make sure you increase your maximum ability points to compensate for the points you spent to earn that ability.

If you made up new abilities or improvements, it's a good idea to make sure you take some time to talk them over with your table and/or your GM before you introduce them.

## Upgrading Abilities

As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either **give them an extra effect** or **make them stronger**.

### Giving an Ability an Additional Effect

Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. If an ability gave you an extra **d6** when gathering information about a monster, giving it an extra effect might allow you to create a **1d6** [stack](../gameplay/stacks.md) named _I know_ [monster name]_'s strengths and weaknesses_ as well. If an ability allowed you to give equipment the _blessed_ and _weapon_ tags, adding an extra effect might let you make a test of _presence_ to heal the wielder too!

### Making an Ability Stronger

If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. If an ability would push a target away from you, a stronger version of the ability might be able to push everyone within a _close range_ of you away instead. If an ability would grant you an extra _d4_ when wielding weapons tagged with _cleaving_, a strengthened version of the ability might give you an extra _d4_ with _cleaving_ or _hooking_-tagged _weapons_. Stronger abilities typically increase the number of targets, the duration of effects, or broaden the situations in which an ability might apply.

## Abilities Growing with Level

When making an ability, you may not want all aspects of the ability to be improved by a player choosing to **improve an ability**-- increasing the difficulties for tests, the size of stacked dice, or the **+X** tag on ability-created equipment aren't things that necessarily feel rewarding to level up. Improving an ability should always feel like an improvement, it should never feel like keeping up.

To that end, certain aspects of abilities should increase automatically as a character levels up. Dice stacked by an ability, for example, might start as d4s at level 1 and increase every two levels until level 8, when they become d12s. Test difficulties might increase by 10 every level. Here are some suggestions:

| Level | Die  | Equipment Quality | Test difficulty |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------------- | ------- |
| 1         | 1d4  | +0                |0|
| 2         | 1d4  | +1                |10|
| 3         | 1d6  | +2                |20|
| 4         | 1d6  | +3                |30|
| 5         | 1d8  | +4                |40|
| 6         | 1d8  | +5                |50|
| 7         | 1d10 | +6                |60|
| 8         | 1d10 | +7                |70|
| 9         | 1d12 | +8                |80|
| 10+       | 1d12 | +9                |90|

You can also tie effects to things that are automatically improved every level like health, passive ability scores, and total dice.

## Let's Make Some Abilities

All right, we've spent enough time talking about how they work. Let's make some ability points and an ability to use them.

### Tinkering Inventor

What if our character was a _Tinkering Inventor_? Someone who can always make the right tools for the job. Their abilities could be the inventions they create, powered by the **scrap** that the Inventor uses to make them. One ability could be **Springloaded Boots**-- a cobbled together contraption that allows the wearer to leap further and run faster... until it breaks. That's pretty easy to represent as stacks of dice that the Inventor puts together over some downtime.

Ability points: **Scrap**
Ability: **Springloaded Boots**

| Requirements                                     | Effect                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can... | ...stack 4d4 Springloaded Boots in somebody's favor. |

And upgrading it would probably mean making the boots last longer and be more durable, so we can just increase the number of dice stacked.

| Requirements                                     | Effect                                                       |
| :----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending 1 scrap over some downtime, I can... | ...stack 8d4 Springloaded Boots in somebody's favor. |

### Alchemist

What if our character was an _Alchemist_ who produced poisons and potions? Their abilities could be the various potions effects they know how to make, powered by the **concoctions** that the Alchemist brews when the party rests. One ability could be a **Health Potion** that heals a bit of damage.

Ability points: **Concoctions**
Ability: **Health Potion**

| Requirements                                       | Effect                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| By spending 1 concoction I can use an action to... | ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach. |

We could then upgrade this potion to give it a secondary effect-- perhaps a stack of dice for being invigorated?

| Requirements                                       | Effect                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending 1 concoction I can use an action to... | ...heal 10 damage from 1 target I can reach and stack 2d4 Invigorated in their favor. |

### Unassuming Assassin

What if our character was an _Unassuming Assassin_? Someone small or frail who nonetheless is a lethal threat. Their abilities could be powered by their ability to mentally note their enemy's weak spots with **assassin's marks**. One ability could be **Strike Their Weaknesses**-- a technique to make attacks with anything based on intuitive analysis rather than strength or speed.

Ability points: **Assassin's Marks**
Ability: **Strike Their Weaknesses**

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending an assassin's mark when I'm hidden from my target I can... | ...make attacks as though my weapons had the **intuition** tag until the end of my turn. |

Upgrading this ability might allow us to add another tag, maybe the _concealable_ tag.

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending an assassin's mark when I'm hidden from my target I can... | ...make attacks as though my weapons had the **intuition** and **concealable** tags until the end of my turn. |

### Internet Savant

What if our character was an _Internet Savant_ who mastered the art of utilizing the collective human knowledge present on the web? Their abilities could be powered by their **cellular data**. A core ability of theirs could be **There's a Wiki for That**, because of course there is.

Ability points: **Cellular Data**
Ability: **There's a Wiki for That**

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| By spending a point of cellular data when I spend some downtime to research information I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. |

Upgrading this ability might allow the Savant to utilize some tidbits they picked up when researching as a stack of dice.

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of cellular data when I spend some downtime to research information I can... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll and stack 4d4 in my favor named after what I researched. |

### Street Brawler

What if our character was a _Street Brawler_ who was used to using anything at their disposal in a scrap? Their abilities could be powered by their **reputation** as a fighter. An ability of theirs could be **Everything's a Weapon in My Hands**, letting them improvise weapons from whatever they can grab.

Ability points: **Reputation**
Ability: **Everything's a Weapon in My Hands**

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of reputation when I'm using equipment without the **weapon** tag... | ...I can give it the **weapon** tag for the scene. _(The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one)_ |

Upgrading this ability could make those weapons more lethal by giving them an extra tag.

| Requirements                                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of reputation when I'm using equipment without the **weapon** tag... | ...I can give it the **weapon** tag for the scene. It also gets the **+1** tag if it isn't already tagged with a bigger **+X** tag. _(The GM will give it an attribute tag if it doesn't already have one)_ |

## Improving an Ability Throughout a Campaign

Here's a more in-detail example of how one could make an ability stronger over the course of multiple enhancements.

Let's start with the ability **Berserking**

#### Berserking

| Requirements                                           | Effect                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... | ...add an extra 1d4 to my roll. |

A good starting point, but let's see if we can make it more interesting.

The next chance we get to improve abilities, we choose to **make the ability stronger**. We can't increase the number of dice that we have, but we can change the dice into a stack that can be used more than once. Since stacks are more broadly useful than just attacks, let's also change the trigger to an action.

#### Berserking II

| Requirements                                           | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... | ...stack **2d4 Berserking** in my favor for the scene. |

Already this is looking jucier. Now, not only do we get a 1d4 bonus to attacks, but we can also spend the dice from the stack for breaking down doors, resisting mind control, and all kinds of other stuff that having a **Berserking** stack might help with.

Where do we go from here? Well, a simple route would just be to increase the number of dice that we have on the Berserking stack to get more Berserking Time, but what if we made it a special stack? We'd need our gamemaster's approval and their help making some balanced tweaks, but with their help we could come up with something like...

#### Berserking III

| Requirements                                           | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... | ...stack **1d4 Berserking** in my favor for the scene with the following rules:  |

> **Berserking**
>
> When you **make an attack**, stack another die.
> The first time you **take damage** each turn, stack another die.
> If you end your turn without removing a die from the stack, they are all lost.

This is what our gamemaster helped us come up with. They're a special stack that feeds themselves the more that we attack and take damage, but have the downside of needing to be used at least once on each of our turns or they go away. Now we're really getting somewhere! 

But... what if we could make it _even better?_ Our gamemaster has an idea for that-- they say that if we want to, we can upgrade the ability again to remove the restriction that causes us to lose the stack.

#### Berserking IV

| Requirements                                           | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By spending a point of fury, I can use an action to... | ...stack **1d4 Berserking** in my favor for the scene with the following rules: |

> **Berserking**
>
> When you **make an attack**, stack another die.
> The first time you **take damage** each turn, stack another die.

Wow. We are now three improvements deep into this ability and it feels pretty powerful indeed. By spending just one of our resources, we get powerful  these dice that we can feed off of making attacks and taking damage, like a true berserker might. If we play our cards right, we'll be adding dice front, left, and center all battle long!

## Keeping it All "Balanced"

Gamemasters, as you've been reading through this section you're probably wondering if there's some kind of behind-the-scenes mechanic for making a balanced ability. The short answer is: there isn't.

The longer answer is there isn't, but not for a lack of trying. I spent quite some time working out various systems for point-buying your way to "balanced" abilities, but at the end of the day they all ended up being unbalanced in one way or another. After all, if you have an ability that gives you an extra d8 when you attack an undead enemy, how useful that ability is depends entirely on how often the GM pits you against undead enemies. If you have an ability to fly, how useful that ability is depends on how often you need to and couldn't otherwise.

Rather than try to balance abilities from the get-go, I'd encourage balancing abilities _as you go_. If an ability feels too strong? Give it an extra requirement, or make one of its requirements more costly! If an ability feels too weak? Give it an extra effect or strengthen one of its existing effects without requiring the character to upgrade it.
