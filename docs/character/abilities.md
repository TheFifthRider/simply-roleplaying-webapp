# Abilities

**Abilities** are your special moves. They're your magic spells, martial art forms, animal transformations, or any other cool mechanic that's specific to your character. And best of all? You decide how they work.

## Ability points

To start with, consider what powers your character's abilities. What makes them able to do the incredible things they do? An ability may cost magic gems, imbued talismans of paper, a source of energy like mana, or anything else you can come up with! 

Whatever you choose it to be, that is their type of **ability points**. You start with a pool of **2** of these ability points, and gain more as you gain additional potential. You spend these points to use abilities, and you can recover spent points when you [spend some downtime to recover](../gameplay/downtime.md#recovering). 

You can also recover spent ability points when it makes sense that you would. A mage might be able to replenish their _mana_ from leylines. A grenadier might be able to replenish their _ammunition_ in an arsenal.  A leader might replenish their _pride_ from cheering throngs of admirers.

### Naming and renaming ability points

If you're not sure what you want you want your ability points to be called at the start, it's okay to just call them "ability points" and come up with a name for them later. Eventually, though, you will want them to have a name beacuse it helps to make the flavor of your character come to life!

Similarly, you should feel free to rename your ability points if the name you chose doesn't feel right or if it no longer makes sense.

## Gaining ability points and creating abilities

Every **10 potential you earn** (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two.

Any number of times between sessions you can reduce your maximum ability points by **1** to [learn a new ability](#creating-an-ability), or reduce your maximum ability points by **2** to [improve an existing ability](#improving-existing-abilities). If you happen to have multiple pools of ability points you may reduce any one of them by **1** to learn a new ability, or **2** to improve an existing ability. You can also reduce two of them by **1** to improve an existing ability.

Similarly, between sessions you can remove abilities from your character sheet if you feel like they don't belong-- whether you just don't like how they work or if you feel like they don't make sense to your character anymore. If you do, make sure you increase your maximum ability points to compensate for the points you spent to earn that ability.

If you made up new abilities or improvements, it's a good idea to make sure you take some time to talk them over with your table and/or your GM before you introduce them.

### Advanced actions

One of the easiest ways to create an ability is to power up a [basic action](../gameplay/basic_actions.md) into something more advanced. Here are some examples -- the specific ability points that power them are _italicized_.

#### Attack

> <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **Fireball**
> 
> As an action, you can spend 1 _mp_ to make an Attack with Knowledge against a target within long range and all targets within short range of them.

#### Defend

> <i class="fa-solid fa-shield"></i> **Dodge and Roll**
> 
> When you Defend against an attack, you can spend 1 _slick move_ to move 1 space away from the person who attacked you. If you critically succeed, you can move half your speed instead.

#### Get answers

> <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> **The Dead Speak to Me**
> 
> As an action, you can spend 1 _runed bone_ to roll Presence and Get Answers by speaking with the spirits of the recently departed as long as you have a remnant of them or something they cared about.

#### Help

> <i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Amythest Ward**
> 
> By spending 1 _magical gem_, you can roll Knowledge to Help yourself or any ally within short range by erecting a shimmering purple barrier that wards off attacks. 

#### Hinder

><i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Flashbang Grenade**
>
>By spending 1 _ammunition_, you can roll Intuition to Hinder a target within short range by firing a flashbang from your shoulder cannon.

#### Make progress (on something big)

><i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> **Words of Inspiration**
>
>By spending 1 point of _ridiculous charisma_ you can roll Presence to Make Progress on something you wouldn't normally be able to help with by inspiring someone else who is doing it.

####  Movement

> <i class="fa-solid fa-person-walking"></i> **Slip Past**
> 
> As an action, by spending 1 point of _cunning_, you can Move without people Reacting to your movement. 

#### Prepare

><i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> **Ready for Anything**
>
>By spending 1 _scrappiness_, you can roll Intuition in the minutes before a fight to Prepare for a battle with an enemy, flashing back to any tricks you may have hidden up your sleeve.

#### Test

> <i class="ra ra-diamonds-card"></i> **Mechanisms are My Forte**
> 
> By spending 1 _sprocket_ before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade a d12 to a d20 before rolling.

### New actions

Another way to create abilities is to make entirely new actions! Abilities can do whatever you want them to! Well, as long as your table is cool with it anyway.

If an ability affects someone else, a good rule of thumb is to plan how they might make a [test](../gameplay/tests.md) to resist the effects, setting the **Difficulty** (likely based on your roll or one of your passive attributes) and describing what happens if they **Critically Succeed**, **Succeed**, **Partially Succeed**, or **Fail**.

#### Heal somebody

Test a specific attribute, then heal damage from someone [close](../getting_started/index.md#range-and-spaces) equal to what you rolled.  If you roll higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes.

> <i class="fa-solid fa-medkit"></i> **Medic Matrix**
> 
> As an action by spending 1 *nyanobot*, test your knowledge to heal that much damage from someone close. If you rolled higher than their total HP, unmark one of their marked injury boxes.

#### Move an enemy

Test a specific attribute against an enemy's passive attributes, then move them if you win!

> <i class ="ra ra-meat-hook"></i>**Grapple Gun**
> 
> As an action, fire your grappling hook arm at an enemy within long range to pull them in closer. Test your brawn against their passive brawn or agility. If you succeed, pull them a short distance toward you.

#### Tag something

Give yourself a tagged item for the scene, or tag parts of yourself as if they were an item. Automatically add the +1 tag at level 2, +2 at level 3, and so on up to +9 at level 10.

> <i class="ra ra-anvil"></i> **Rockin' Abs**
> 
> Once per rest as a reaction, you can spend 1 _muscle point_ to treat your 6 pack as if it was an item with the _brawn_ and _armor_ tags for the scene.

## Upgrading abilities

As you get stronger, so should your abilities! When you upgrade your abilities, usually you're looking to either **give them an extra effect** or **make them stronger**.

### Combine actions

Sometimes you just want an ability to do more. One way to accomplish that is by combining the effects of two basic actions into one roll!

> <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> **I Know the Supernatural**
> 
> As an action, by spending 1 _firsthand supernatural experience_ I can roll Knowledge to **Get Answers** about a supernatural creature I can see. Before I roll, I can trade one of my d12s for a d20.

<div class="arrow-block"><span class="arrow-block-text">Upgrade</span></div>

> <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> **Monster Hunting Expert**
> 
> As two actions, by spending 1 _firsthand supernatural experience_ I can roll Knowledge to both **Get Answers** about a supernatural creature I can see and **Help** myself or others by recalling how to deal with it in the same roll. Before I roll, I can trade one of my d12s for a d20.

Your combined action will usually still require you to spend the same number of total actions, but now that they are one roll both benefit from any strengthening upgrades you provide.

You can also combine already upgraded abilities, or actions you have that nobody else does!

> <i class="ra ra-sword"></i> **Divine Weapon**
> 
> As an action, by spending 1 _faith_ I can give anything the _+5_, _blessed_, _will_, and _weapon_ tags.

<div class="arrow-block"><span class="arrow-block-text">Upgrade</span></div>

> <i class="ra ra-sword"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-medkit"></i> **Blessing of the Golden Ankh**
> 
> As two actions, by spending 1 _faith_ I can roll Will to heal somebody by the amount I rolled. In addition, give something equipped to them the _+5_, _blessed_, _will_, and _weapon_ tags.

If an ability allowed you to give an item the _blessed_ and _weapon_ tags, adding an extra effect might let you test your Presence to heal the wielder too!

### Making an Action Stronger

If you want an ability to do what it already does, but better, you can amplify its effects. 

One way is to trade a d12 for a d20, or increasing the number of d12s are traded into d20s.

> <i class="ra ra-diamonds-card"></i> **Mechanisms are My Forte**
> 
> By spending 1 _sprocket_ before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade a d12 to a d20 before rolling.

<div class="arrow-block"><span class="arrow-block-text">Upgrade</span></div>

> <i class="ra ra-diamonds-card"></i> **Mechanisms are My Forte +**
> 
> By spending 1 _sprocket_ before rolling on a test to finesse machinery, produce the exact right tool for the job. Upgrade two d12s to d20s before rolling.

Another way is by adding additional tags, or increasing the magnitude of those tags!

> <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **Fireball**
> 
> As an action, you can spend 1 _mp_ to make an Attack with Knowledge against a target within _long range_ and all targets within _short range_ of them.

<div class="arrow-block"><span class="arrow-block-text">Upgrade</span></div>

> <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> **Firestorm**
> 
> As an action, you can spend 1 _mp_ to make an Attack with Knowledge against a target within _long range_ and all targets within _medium range_ of them.

## Big abilities

Most abilities are going to be the kind you see above, but sometimes you just want to go _bigger_ to summon a meteor storm or telekinetically pull a starship down from the sky. For these sorts of abilities, talk with your GM. It's possible that what you're really trying to do is to [make progress on something big](../gameplay/basic_actions.md#make-progress-on-something-big). 

If you and your GM agree that this is something you should have on your character sheet, then you should pick a way to earn it. Maybe you need to develop the ability as something smaller, and then get the big version after you've upgraded it a certain number of times. Maybe the ability costs more points of potential than a regular one.

Finally, abilities get bigger and badder the more requirements you put on them. If you want a really big ability, you should attach some pretty serious requirements. Most of the time, this is at least spending downtime to prepare the big ability for action. Review [requirements](../running_the_game/creating_abilities.md#requirements) with your GM and pick some that make sense!
