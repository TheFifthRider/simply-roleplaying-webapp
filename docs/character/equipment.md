## Attributes, Weapons, and Armor

Most real weapons and armor would have one or both of the Agility and Brawn tags. It's not necessary for every setting to have weapons for every attribute, but both the players and the GM should be on the same page regarding which attributes are most commonly tagged on weapons and armor  in the GM's setting.
