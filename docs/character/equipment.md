# Items and Inventory

Your **items** are your stuff. They go in your **inventory**. Playing cards, bundles of rope, your trusty blade-- it might be equipment with tags to describe its use, or it might simply be a flavorful item that may or may not have specifically codified effects.

## How much can your inventory hold?

There's not a strict limit to what you can have in your inventory-- your inventory should be able to hold everything you need, but it probably should still [make sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth). Unless your setting calls for a reason otherwise, it's generally assumed that you have a backpack, sapient pearwood luggage, or other inventory-management item with you to carry what you need. When in doubt, it's practical to not limit what can be in someone's inventory. Nobody wants to deal with explaining how exactly they're carrying twelve different swords in their backpack.

## Equipped Items

You can have as many things as you want to have in your inventory, but you can only benefit from what's **equipped**. Equipped items are things you're wearing, holding, have on your belt-- anything that you know exactly where it is and can grab it immediately in a pinch. Just like what's in your inventory, what you have equipped should [make sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth). Whenever you have the opportunity, often with [downtime](../gameplay/downtime.md) but it can be as flexible as your GM would like, you can equip and unequip items.

When you're in an [action scenario](../gameplay/action.md) you can use anything you have equipped without taking any time to pull it out or put it away. If they're not equipped, then you'll have to take **at least one action** to retrieve the items and equip them first. Your GM may say you must use multiple actions if you're trying to get out a lot of things, what you're trying to get needs assembly after being retrieved, or what you're getting is particularly difficult to get out of your portable storage. You can unequip any items necessary for what you have equipped to still [make sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth) as a part of these actions.

Similarly, if you wish to stow items for any reason in an [action scenario](../gameplay/action.md) you can take **at least one action** to unequip them into your inventory. Just like with equipping, if it's something cumbersome or something that requires disassembly before storage your GM may say you must use multiple actions for this.

## Equipment

Equipment are the tools you wear or use to accomplish tasks-- your armor, weapons, magic staves, and lockpick set. Equipment might be protective, weaponized, or useful in some other way. **Tags** describe what's important about the equipment: how it can be used, what benefits it provides, and anything else that matters. You can only benefit from **equipment** if they're equipped.

### Tags

Here's a suggested list of tags that you can use to describe the equipment in your game. Be sure to add more tags that are important to your setting! If you're in a dark fantasy setting hunting beasts of the night and need silvered weapons to confront them, _silver_ should be a tag. If you're in a futuristic dystopian setting and everything legally acquired is monitored through a chip, _unchipped_ should be a tag.

As a general rule of thumb, **tag things when they need to be tagged**. An iron sword doesn't need to be tagged with _iron_ when an adventurer picks it up, but the instant they start a plot thread of investigating something that's vulnerable to cold iron, it should be.

#### +1, +2, +3, ...

Equipment with this tag are more effective than other equipment of the same type due to exemplary craftsmanship, materials, and/or renown.
