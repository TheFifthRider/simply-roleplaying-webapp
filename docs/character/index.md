# What Makes Up a Character?

A character in Simply Roleplaying is made up of several different pieces. If you're creating a character for the first time, you may want to check out the walkthrough in [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md). The content on this page and that page are almost the same, this one is just aimed at breaking everything on your character sheet down while that page is aimed at walking you through setting it up.

## Level

Your **level** represents, generally, how strong you are. You add this to your attributes to determine the total number of dice you can roll from your skills, legacies, and backgrounds.

## Health and Injuries

Health is how much [damage](health.md#damage) you can take before you suffer an [injury](health.md#injury). Injuries take time to recover from, and if you take too many you'll be [defeated](health.md#defeat). Injuries are both a box and a line describing the harm you took -- only the box matters for gameplay purposes, the text is just to remind you what happened so you know when it [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth) to recover from it.

## Attributes

[Attributes](attributes.md) are broad categories which represent your strengths and weaknesses-- your physical strength, ability to quickly respond, willpower, and more. Any time you make a [test of ability](../gameplay/tests.md), it'll test a specific attribute and you'll add that attribute to your level to determine how many dice to roll. You also have [passive attribute scores](attributes.md#passive-attribute-scores) that you use instead of dice for when you respond reflexively to that attribute being tested.

## Skills, Legacies, and Backgrounds

[Skills, Legacies, and Backgrounds](backgrounds.md) are the individual pieces that make up who you are and what you've learned. [Skills](backgrounds.md#developing-skills) describe what you know how to do: anything concrete that you can get better at, given practice. [Legacies](backgrounds.md#earning-legacies) describe your reputation: your values, the factions you've allied with, and the deeds you've done. [Backgrounds](backgrounds.md#building-a-background) describe you: they're built from Skills and Legacies put together and summarized.

## Abilities and Ability Points

[Abilities](abilities.md) are the unique and cool things your character can do. Casting magic, building inventions, or memorizing crucial details all can go here. [Ability points](abilities.md#ability-points) are a pool of points that you can spend on doing cool ability stuff.

## Inventory

Your [inventory](equipment.md) is filled with all the stuff you own. Anything you can use to accomplish a task usually has [tags](equipment.md#tags) that describe its properties. Items in your inventory are either equipped or not-- equipped items are usually visible and easy to get to, unequipped items are stored away somewhere on your person.

## Companions

Your [companions](companions.md) are anyone else who travels with you, but doesn't need a full character sheet to represent them. A [helper](companions.md#helpers) offers you the support of their skills. An [ally](companions.md#allies) has attributes, damage, and inventory of their own, but shares your level, injuries, skills, legacies, backgrounds, and abilities.
