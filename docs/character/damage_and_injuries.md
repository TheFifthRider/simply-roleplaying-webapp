# Damage and Injuries

## Damage

**Damage** is the amount of energy that a character has to handle strenuous and dangerous things. A character's **health** is the maximum amount of damage a character can sustain before sustaining a lasting injury. Health is calculated based on the die level of a character's brawn die as explained in [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md) and can be increased by [milestones](../gameplay/advancement.md).

Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or risk, they subtract that damage from their health. When their health would reach or go below 0, they take an injury and then reset their health.

## Injuries

**Injuries** are lasting physical or mental consequence that bring a character closer to death. Whenever a character suffers an injury: erase all damage taken so far, mark an injury box, and if the line next to it is blank, write a brief description of the injury.

While the gamemaster ultimately has final say over what the injury is, any player can offer a suggestion for what kind of an injury a character may have taken. Some examples of injuries are a _fractured wrist_ from blocking a crushing mace blow, _exhaustion_ following an inventing all-nighter, or a _shoulder bite to the bone_ from a rat of unusual size.

### Defeat

If a character suffers an injury when all of their injury boxes are marked, their injuries have caught up to them and they are **defeated**. What that means depends on the situation; they might have been paralyzed by fear, captured, swallowed, traumatized... they might even be dead. Whatever happened, they're out of the action until the end of the scene and should probably take some downtime to recover.

#### Defeat and Death

Gamemasters, defeat _can_ mean death for a character but it shouldn't always. In fact, it should probably only mean death when that propels the story forward in an interesting way. If the defeat is for one of your players, this should count double. Always check with your players before putting their character's life on the line-- the threat of death can be a compelling and interesting aspect of a campaign, but when it happens abruptly due to a few bad rolls it can do more to harm the game than help it.

## Recovering

If a character **rests**, they restore their health to full. Whenever the character spends [some downtime](../gameplay/downtime.md#recovering) resting, they may additionally erase all marked injury boxes on their character sheets.

If the rest was enough to fully heal the injury, erase the description next to the marked injury box. Otherwise, keep it around or rename it to reflect the healing process. Recovering doesn't mean those wounds have completely healed, just that they are healed enough that they are no longer bringing your character closer to a life-threatening injury. If you need to check that injury box again, it means those wounds reopened.

### Healing

Healing is a way of expediting the process of recovery. If a character receives medical treatment for one of their injuries over **a short time** they may erase the marked injury box from their character sheet in addition to erasing all of their accumulated damage. Your gamemaster may rule that a character must have access to medical supplies appropriate for treating the injury and/or that they must make a test of knowledge to treat the injury.
