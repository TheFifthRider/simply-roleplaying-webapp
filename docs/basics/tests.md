# Tests of Ability

Whenever a character attempts to do something with a goal in mind, a risk present, and an uncertainty of whether either or both will happen, the gamemaster will call for a test of ability to determine what happens next. A **test of ability** (or **test** for short) is resolved by rolling an _attribute_ die, along with some combination of _skill_ and _background_ dice to meet or exceed a number that represents the difficulty of doing what they want to do.

While most tests emerge fluidly from gameplay and don't require this level of detail, a fully written test would look something like this:

>  **Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant**
>
>  _Difficulty **15** Test of **Presence**_
>
>  ****
>
>  **Goal:** Turning a profit on contraband
>
>  **Risk:** The merchant might be insulted or involve the authorities
>
>  ****
>
>  If they...
>
>  * **Fail:** the merchant refuses to do business with you ever again and tips off the authorities
>  * **Partially succeed:** the merchant refuses to buy the contraband and threatens to involve the authorities if you ever try to sell them contraband again
>  * **Fully succeed:** you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal
>  * **Critically succeed:** not only does the merchant accept the deal but they happen to be a known fence in the area and look forward to working with you again

## Establishing Difficulty

Most of the time, the difficulty is a static number determined by the gamemaster based on the skill required to achieve success with minimal risk. Below are a collection of difficulty rules of thumb. When creating a test, it's a good idea to start with a difficulty based on one of the rules of thumb and increase or decrease it by a few points depending on how easy or difficult the test is meant to be.

* **Talented but inexperienced** characters who have yet to earn a milestone can handle tests of difficulty **5**
* **Experienced** characters who have earned a milestone can handle tests of difficulty **10**
* **Professionals** who have earned two milestones can handle tests of difficulty **20**
* **Experts** who have earned three milestones can handle tests of difficulty **30**
* **Masters** who have earned four milestones can handle tests of difficulty **40**
* Only **Legendary** characters can attempt to handle tests of difficulty **50 or higher**

Players, the difficulty rules of thumb can also help you gauge your character's proficiency. If you're regularly rolling above a 15 on a test, chances are you are on the same level as someone who performs those sorts of tests for a living. Gamemasters, if you choose to use more than three skill milestones and three attribute milestones, you should consider writing your own rules of thumb not only to help yourself consistently apply difficulties across your world, but also to help your players understand what rolling a 10 means when compared to the rest of your world's citizens.

<br/>

### Competitions

When characters directly compete with each other, the gamemaster may rule that it is appropriate to resolve the test by comparing each competing character's roll against each other instead of against a static difficulty. In these **competitions**, the rolls of the other competing characters are considered the difficulty of the test.

<br/>

## Resolving Tests

In most cases the gamemaster will determine what attribute(s) are applicable for the skill check in question and the player will offer up suggestions of skills and/or backgrounds that they have on their character sheet to add the dice associated with those skills and/or backgrounds. A character can contribute one skill or background die to a test of ability up to the total amount allowed by their earned [milestones](/basics/milestones/).

<br/>

### Aid

Before the dice are rolled, any character who can reasonably use one of their skills or backgrounds to help the character performing the test may offer their aid by choosing the appropriate die and rolling it with the character attempting the test. The character attempting the test may then choose a number of dice up to the total amount allowed by their earned [milestones](/basics/milestones/) to use for the test.

All characters who aid in the test help the tested character reach their goal, making success more likely, but each character who aids in the test also either introduce a new risk to the test or somehow worsen the existing risk, making failure all the more dangerous. If the initial risk was a deadly pitfall, the aiding character could be at risk of falling in as well. If the initial risk was taking too long to researching an antidote before the poison took hold, the additional minds involved might result in a fatal miscommunication.

<br/>

## Determining the Outcome

Once the attribute, backgrounds, and skills are all chosen, the dice are rolled and the gamemaster compares the total result to the difficulty of the test and describes what happens. If a character's roll meets or exceeds the difficulty of the test, they have **succeeded** and are able to do what they set out to do. If a character's roll does not meet the difficulty of the test, they have **failed** and things are about to get bad for them.

While success does mean that the character has accomplished what they wanted to, how well they have succeeded determines how much any risks involved affect them. 

If a character rolls 20 or more over the difficulty of a test, they have **critically succeeded**; they either avoid the risks involved entirely or succeed to an incredible degree. 

If a character rolls 10 or more over the difficulty of a test, they have **fully succeeded**; they did what they set out to do and minimize any associated risks.

If a character only meets or exceeds the difficulty of a test, they have **partially succeeded**; they did what they set out to do but they're going to take the brunt of the risks involved.

If a character does not meet the difficulty of the test, they have **failed**-- they don't do what they set out to do and they are either going to suffer the worst possible case of the risks involved or introduce a new risk.

<br/>

### Determining the Outcome of a Competition

Determining the outcome of a competition in which there are two participants is done the same way as determining the outcome in a test with a static difficulty. When more than one character is involved, characters are instead often **ranked from highest to lowest**, based on their roll. The gamemaster can then use these positions to describe the result of the competition based on the relative placement of the competitors.

## Example of a Test

Let's bring it all together and walk through a test of ability using the **Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant** example above:

> A thief character attempts to _turn a profit on some contraband_. Since this is an action that carries the risk of _the merchant becoming upset or involving the authorities_ and some uncertainty between which of the goal and the risk will occur, the gamemaster calls for a test of ability.
>
> Given the social nature of the action, the gamemaster says that convincing the merchant is going to be a test of _Presence_ and secretly marks down a difficulty of _15_, since they rule that this requires professional expertise.
>
> On the thief's character sheet are the backgrounds _Smuggler_ and _Mercenary_, as well as the skills, _Acrobatics_, _Lockpicking_, and _Intimidation_. Based on their current goal, they choose their background _Smuggler_, and their skill _Intimidation_ as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation.
>
> The gamemaster agrees that these are good choices, so the thief rolls their 1d10 Presence, 1d6 Intimidation, and 1d12 for their Smuggler background.
>
> They roll a 10, a 5, and a 5 for a total of 20--  a spectacular roll. They have a +5 attribute modifier to their Presence, bringing the total of the roll up to 25.
>
> The difficulty of the test was _15_, and 25 is 10 higher than the difficulty, which makes it a _full success_. which means _you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal_. Based on the skills used, the gamemaster now has everything they need to paint a picture of how the sweating merchant responds to the smuggler's intimidation and ultimately gives in.

## Other Types of Outcomes

Accomplishing what a character set out to do can be nebulous, especially when a the goal of a test is complicated or open ended. In those cases, consider the following rules for handling situations where the goal is to **make progress** on a larger task, or to **gather information**.

### Progress as an Outcome

Sometimes the goal of a test is to make **progress** on a larger goal that can't be resolved by just one test. Such goal might be making something complicated, taking out an enemy, or working as a crew to steer a ship through obstacles. The GM will create a progress meter for the overarching goal of the tests the players-- a total number to reach in order to accomplish the overall goal. Any tests that help accomplish the overall goal can help fill the meter. You can represent this meter just by a total number to hit, or you can draw it on a piece of paper to help illustrate the overall progress, whatever works best for your group.

When a character makes a test of any attribute with a goal to **fill a progress meter**, if they...

*   **Fail:** They instead make things more complicated, either by falling victim to an existing risk or introducing a new one.
*   **Partially succeed:** They are able to make some progress. Fill the progress meter by half of what they rolled.
*   **Fully succeed:** They make great progress. Fill the progress meter by what they rolled.
*   **Critically Succeed:** They make incredible progress. Fill the progress meter by twice what they rolled.

<br/>

### Information as an Outcome

Sometimes the goal of a test is to find **answers to questions**. Such a goal might be researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual. In this case, the results of measure success in number of questions answered. The gamemaster may provide questions that are available to be asked, or allow any question to be asked. 

When a character makes a test of any attribute to **find answers to questions**, if they...

*   **Fail:** They get unreliable information-- they may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely.
*   **Partially succeed:** They learn some information-- they may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully.
*   **Succeed:** They learn a good amount of information-- they may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully.
*   **Critically Succeed:** They learn a significant amount of information-- they may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully.

The answers to the questions should make sense contextually and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question **"Who killed this person?"** with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with **"someone with red hair and a blue cloak"** based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby.

Questions should never feel wasted. If the answer to a question was plain or common knowledge and would not normally require a test to uncover, it should be answered without counting against the number of questions that the tested character can ask. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, the person asked the question should indicate why it is not answerable and it will not count against the number of questions that the character can ask.

Players, if your gamemaster allows you to ask any question but you're not sure what to ask, **"What questions should I ask?"** can be a solid question to ask, since learning the right questions to ask is a crucial step in information gathering. Gamemasters, if this is a question that is somehow unanswerable, make sure you have an answer as to why and how it can become answerable.

<br/>

## Good Tests

A test of ability is fundamentally useless without a **goal**, a **risk**, and an **uncertainty**. Without uncertainty, the narrative already clearly indicates what will happen and to roll the dice could introduce uncertainty that breaks immersion. Without a goal, the roller's agency is subverted-- if they don't know what they're trying to do, the number rolled doesn't mean anything to them. Without a risk, failure has no weight and the test is drained of tension. The concept of goals and risks is something that relies on the players being immersed in their character, their surroundings, and the world at large. If you're playing with a bunch of people new to the system, take some time in an introductory dungeon to help your players think in terms of the goals they want to perform and the risks that might come with them.

<br/>

### Goal Guidelines

Goals are a statement of intent and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. Gamemasters, this is the part of skill checks that fall on the players to define. You should be prepared to ask questions until you are absolutely certain of the intention of the player's actions. If a player doesn't know what they are trying to do in the situation, the gamemaster should present some options like you might find in a choose-your-own-adventure novel.

<br/>

### Risk Guidelines

Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as taking a chainsaw to the chest, and should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night or missing a crucial detail.
