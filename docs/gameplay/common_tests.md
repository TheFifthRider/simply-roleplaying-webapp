# Basic Tests

While it's true that your gamemaster will create [tests](tests.md) to fit the situation, here are some that you might perform often and their usual results. Of course, there may be extra risks or slightly different goals depending on the situation, but these should cover your bases! Consider these as "here's what I can do" in any given situation.

<br/>

## Attacking a Target

Attacking is a [test](tests.md) of whatever attribute makes sense for the attack, usually against the roll of somebody who is defending against you! If your target cannot or does not defend, the difficulty is their passive brawn. If your target isn't a character and doesn't have passive brawn, you're actually probably [progressing a complicated goal](#progressing-a-complicated-goal).

When you make a test of any attribute with a goal to **attack with a weapon**, if you...

*   **Fail:** Your target either takes no damage at all or half damage, depending on how well the defender rolled.
*   **Partially succeed:** Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to your roll.
*   **Fully succeed:** Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to your roll.
*   **Critically Succeed:**  Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to twice your roll. 

<br/>

## Defending against an Attack

If somebody attacks you, you can try to defend against the attack and turn it into a contest of their attack roll and whatever attribute you're defending with. You can also defend against an attack targeted at someone else as long as it [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth), but you will take any damage they would have taken. If you...

* **Fail:** You take damage equal to the attacker's roll, or equal to double the attacker's roll depending on how well they rolled.
* **Partially succeed:**  You take half of the attacker's roll as [damage](../character/health.md).
* **Fully succeed:** You take half of what the attacker rolled as [damage](../character/health.md).
* **Critically succeed:** You take no damage.

<br/>

## Stacking dice for or against someone

When you make a test of any attribute to **stack dice for or against someone**, if you...

*   **Fail:** Stack two dice against yourself, or remove two dice from the existing stack
*   **Partially succeed:** Stack two dice on the new or existing stack
*   **Fully succeed:** Stack three dice on the new or existing stack
*   **Critically Succeed:**  Stack four dice on the new or existing stack

<br/>

## Unstacking dice

When you make a test of any attribute to **remove dice from a stack**, if you...

*   **Fail:** Stack two dice instead
*   **Partially succeed:** Take two dice off of the stack
*   **Fully succeed:** Take three dice off of the stack
*   **Critically Succeed:**  Take four dice off of the stack

<br/>

## Finding answers to questions

If you're trying to **answers to questions**, whether it's by researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual, make a [test](../gameplay/tests.md) of the appropriate attribute and then ask the GM some questions.

When you make a test of any attribute to **find answers to questions**, if you...

*   **Fail:** You may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely
*   **Partially succeed:** You may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully
*   **Succeed:** You may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully
*   **Critically Succeed:** You may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully

If you're not sure what to ask, **"What questions should I ask?"** is always a good question. It counts towards the number of questions you get, but hones in on the juicy stuff your GM might have for you to discover. It's also realistic-- it's not often that a character knows what question they're trying to answer right when they start looking for information.

The answers to the questions should both make sense and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question **"Who killed this person?"** with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with **"someone with red hair and a blue cloak"** based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby.

Questions cannot be wasted. If the answer to a question was already stated, it doesn't count. If the answer to a question would not normally require a test to uncover, it doesn't count. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, it doesn't count and the person asked the question should explain why it is not answerable and how to make it answerable, if possible.

<br/>

## Progressing a complicated goal

If you're trying to do something and you can't do it in just one test, your GM may say that the goal of your test is to fill a [progress meter](../running_the_game/creating_tests.md#progress-meters)!

When you make a test of any attribute to **fill a progress meter**, if you...

*   **Fail:** You instead make things more complicated, either by falling victim to an existing risk or introducing a new one
*   **Partially succeed:** Fill the progress meter by half of what you rolled
*   **Fully succeed:** Fill the progress meter by what you rolled
*   **Critically Succeed:** Fill the progress meter by twice what you rolled

<br/>

## Make Preparations

When a character takes some downtime and makes a test of any attribute with a goal to **prepare for a situation**, if they...

*   **Fail:** They stack two flashback dice, but one of them is guaranteed to go wrong.
*   **Partially succeed:** They stack two flashback dice.
*   **Fully succeed:** They stack three flashback dice.
*   **Critically Succeed:** They stack four flashback dice.
