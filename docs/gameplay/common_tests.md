# Basic Tests

While it's true that your gamemaster will create [tests](tests.md) to fit the situation, here are some that you might perform often and their usual results. Of course, there may be extra risks or slightly different goals depending on the situation, but these should cover your bases! Consider these as "here's what I can do" in any given situation.

## Attacking a Target that Takes the Hit

Attacking with a [weapon](../character/equipment.md) is a [test](tests.md) of one of the attributes that the weapon is tagged with against a difficulty of the [armor value](../character/equipment.md) of a target within the range [tagged](../character/equipment.md) on the weapon.

If you attack with something that doesn't have the weapon tag or with a weapon in a way that it's not intended to be used, your GM may say there is an [additional risk](tests.md#risk-guidelines) of **the weapon might be damaged, destroyed, or otherwise lost** and/or **some tags on the weapon do not apply**.

When you make a test of any attribute with a goal to **attack with a weapon**, if you...

*   **Fail:** Your target takes half damage.
*   **Partially succeed:** Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to your roll.
*   **Fully succeed:** Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to your roll.
*   **Critically Succeed:**  Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to twice your roll.

## Defending against an Attack

If somebody attacks you, you can try to defend against the attack and turn it into a contest of their attack roll and whatever attribute you're defending with. If you...

* **Fail and they critically succeed:** You take double damage and stack 2d8 against you with a name reflecting your failed defense.
* **Fail and they fully succeed:** You take the full damage of their roll and stack 1d8 against you with a name reflecting your failed defense.
* **Fail and they partially succeed:** You take the full damage of their roll.
* **Partially succeed:**  You take half damage.
* **Fully succeed:** You take no damage and stack 1d8 against them with a name reflecting your successful defense.
* **Critically succeed:** You take no damage and stack 2d8 against them with a name reflecting your successful defense.

## Stacking dice for or against someone

When you make a test of any attribute to **stack dice for or against someone**, if you...

*   **Fail:** Stack two dice against yourself, or remove two dice from the existing stack
*   **Partially succeed:** Stack two dice on the new or existing stack
*   **Fully succeed:** Stack three dice on the new or existing stack
*   **Critically Succeed:**  Stack four dice on the new or existing stack

<br/>

## Unstacking dice

When you make a test of any attribute to **remove dice from a stack**, if you...

*   **Fail:** Stack two dice instead
*   **Partially succeed:** Take two dice off of the stack
*   **Fully succeed:** Take three dice off of the stack
*   **Critically Succeed:**  Take four dice off of the stack

<br/>

## Finding answers to questions

If you're trying to **answers to questions**, whether it's by researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual, make a [test](../gameplay/tests.md) of the appropriate attribute and then ask the GM some questions.

When you make a test of any attribute to **find answers to questions**, if you...

*   **Fail:** You may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely
*   **Partially succeed:** You may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully
*   **Succeed:** You may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully
*   **Critically Succeed:** You may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully

If you're not sure what to ask, **"What questions should I ask?"** is always a good question. It counts towards the number of questions you get, but hones in on the juicy stuff your GM might have for you to discover. It's also realistic-- it's not often that a character knows what question they're trying to answer right when they start looking for information.

The answers to the questions should both make sense and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question **"Who killed this person?"** with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with **"someone with red hair and a blue cloak"** based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby.

Questions cannot be wasted. If the answer to a question was already stated, it doesn't count. If the answer to a question would not normally require a test to uncover, it doesn't count. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, it doesn't count and the person asked the question should explain why it is not answerable and how to make it answerable, if possible.

## Progressing a complicated goal

If you're trying to do something and you can't do it in just one test, your GM may say that the goal of your test is to fill a [progress meter](../running_the_game/creating_tests.md#progress-meters)!

When you make a test of any attribute to **fill a progress meter**, if you...

*   **Fail:** You instead make things more complicated, either by falling victim to an existing risk or introducing a new one
*   **Partially succeed:** Fill the progress meter by half of what you rolled
*   **Fully succeed:** Fill the progress meter by what you rolled
*   **Critically Succeed:** Fill the progress meter by twice what you rolled

<br/>

## Making preparations

While it can be rewarding to act out the players gathering information before going on a heist or gearing up before setting out on adventure, sometimes it's more fun to roll for preparation and cut to the chase. 

When a character takes some downtime and makes a test of any attribute with a goal to **prepare for a situation**, if they...

*   **Fail:** They get two flashbacks, but one of them is guaranteed to go wrong.
*   **Partially succeed:** They get two flashbacks.
*   **Fully succeed:** They get three flashbacks.
*   **Critically Succeed:** They get four flashbacks

### What are flashbacks?

When the GM describes a complication that your preparation could have resolved, you can spend one of your **flashbacks** to take the narrative back in time to describe how your preparation dealt with that problem.

>   An adventuring party in Victorian London is investigating an elusive murderer. In an effort to capture them, the group takes a few days to take in the crime scene and prepare.
>
>   Later, the group finds themselves deep in the sewers chasing after their quarry. In an effort to catch up to them, the mastermind of the group **flashes back** to purchasing a sewer map from a descendant of one of the original architects. The player marks off the cost of the map and uses it to corner the suspect and force a confrontation.

Not every preparation is guaranteed to succeed, however. The GM is well within their rights to ask you to make a test of ability to see how well your preparation holds up, or even if things go well for you.

>   An adventuring party plans to steal from a high security vault. They take a few days to case the joint.
>
>   Later, the group is deep within the compound when they discover an impenetrable web of security lasers. The hacker **flashes back** to making preparations to temporarily disable the security. The GM asks them to roll to see if they're able to bypass the vault's security-- and for how long. The hacker manages a partial success-- long enough to get them in to grab what they needed, but not long enough to keep them from tripping the lasers on their way back out the door!

### No rewriting history

It's important to note that flashbacks **cannot** rewrite history. If a guard sounded the alarm, no amount of flashing back to bribing them will undo that the alarm has been pressed. However, if the GM describes the alarm being pressed but hasn't yet described the flashing lights, it's totally valid for someone with tech savviness to cut in with a flashback to disabling the alarm system before the party made their way in.

That said, don't be a jerk about this rule. The goal is to encourage a flow to the improvisational "yes, and..." of playing a roleplaying game, not to make every dramatic encounter a race to using a flashback before the GM finishes describing a new threat. GMs, give spaces for players to offer up flashbacks and prompt your players if you think they may have forgotten. Players, trust that your GM will offer you these opportunities and don't interrupt them in an unwelcome fashion.
