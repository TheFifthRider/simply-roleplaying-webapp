# Advancement

## Every Session

At the end of every session, a character earns some amount of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills), varying based on the significance of what happened in the campaign. This is ultimately up to the gamemaster to determine, but about one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is usually right for an average session.

<br/>

## Checklists and Goals

An interactive way of determining how many points of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with "Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we..."-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential.

Here are some end-of-session goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session, along with the milestone instructions in checklist form.

<br/>

### At the end of a session:

* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we accomplished something new and important
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we learned something important about the world, or if something important changed
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we learned something important about a player character, or if something important changed

## Abilities

Every **10 potential you earn** (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two.

<br/>

## Milestones

Milestones are markers of when the player characters advance and are awarded to celebrate the significant things the players have accomplished over the course of the game. Milestones typically occur at the end of significant arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost-- usually about every 25 potential earned.

In addition, whenever a character achieves a milestone they choose **one**:

*   Increase their **dice** by 1
*   Increase their [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier)

If they choose to increase their **dice** by 1, that increases the maximum number of dice they can roll by 1. If they choose to increase their attribute modifiers, they must pick two of their modifiers to increase by **4**, two others to increase by **3**, and then increase their final two modifiers by **2**.

Then, they choose **one**:

* Increase their maximum [damage](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 6 and their maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 9
* Increase their maximum [damage](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 12 and their maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 6
* Increase their maximum [damage](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 18 and their maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 3

In addition to the power bump, milestones also provide a space for the GM and players to check-in and rework any aspects of character that just aren't working. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Forget any number of skills, and reclaim your spent potential
* Rename any number of skills
* Invest any unspent potential on any skills you want
* Combine any number of d12 skills into backgrounds
* Rename any backgrounds you want
* Erase any abilities you want, and reclaim your spent maximum ability points
* Gain any number of new abilities, spending 1 maximum ability point for each
* Improve abilities any number of times, spending 2 maximum ability points for each

<br/>

### Milestone Checklist

**When a milestone is achieved....**

    1. Increase two [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier) by 4
    2. Increase another two [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier) by 3
    3. Increase the last two [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier) by 2


Choose **one:**
