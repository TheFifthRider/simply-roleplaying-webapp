## Every Session

At the end of every session, a character earns some amount of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills), varying based on the significance of what happened in the campaign. This is ultimately up to the gamemaster to determine, but about one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is usually right for an average session.

<br/>

## Checklists and Goals

An interactive way of determining how many points of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with "Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we..."-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential.

Here are some end-of-session goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session, along with the milestone instructions in checklist form.

<br/>

### At the end of a session:

* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we accomplished something new and important
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we learned something important about the world, or if something important changed
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we learned something important about a player character, or if something important changed

## Abilities

Every **10 potential you earn** (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two.

<br/>

## Milestones

Milestones are markers of when the player characters advance and are awarded to celebrate the significant things the players have accomplished over the course of the game. Milestones typically occur at the end of significant arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. 

Whenever character's achieve milestones, they are awarded a larger than average amount of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills), then they get one of the following benefits:

*   Increase their **dice** by 1

OR

*   Increase their [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier)
    *   Increase two by 4
    *   Increase two others by 3
    *   Increase the last two by 2

And then they also get to do one of the following:

* Increase their maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 6

OR

* Increase their maximum [damage](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 12 and their maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 3

OR

* Increase their maximum [damage](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 24

<br/>

### When to give Milestones

This section is largely for gamemasters, players you can skip it if you'd like. A good rule of thumb for awarding milestones is to give a milestone about every 25 potential earned, and to grant roughly two session's worth of potential when you do so.

<br/>

### When a milestone is achieved:

- Choose **one:**
    * [ ] Increase dice by 1
    * [ ] Increase your [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier)

        1. Increase two [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier) by 4
        2. Increase another two [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier) by 3
        3. Increase the last two [attribute modifiers](../character/attributes.md#attribute-modifier) by 2

- Choose **one:**
    * [ ] Increase your maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 6
    * [ ] Increase your maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 3 and your maximum [damage](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 12
    * [ ] Increase your maximum [damage](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 24
