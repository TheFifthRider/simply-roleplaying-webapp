# Advancement

## Checklists and Goals

At the end of every session, you earn [potential](../character/skills.md#potential) based on how much progress it feels like the characters have made in the story. While your gamemaster can absolutely decide on how much potential to award on their own (one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is about right), roleplaying is constructing a shared narrative and unplanned progress through a character arc is just as important as advancing the plot.

A way everybody can help determine how many points of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with "Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we..."-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential.

Here are some end-of-session goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session, along with the milestone instructions in checklist form.

<br/>

**At the end of a session:**

* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we accomplished something new and important
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we learned something important about the world, or if something important changed
* [ ] Gain a point of [potential](../character/skills.md#honing-your-skills) if we learned something important about a player character, or if something important changed

### Personal Goals

Session goals don't have to be shared-- if your group is comfortable with players having differing amounts of potential, you can play with the idea of having personal goals in addition to the group checklist. You should reduce the number of shared goals if characters have their own personal goals, since you probably want to keep a one-to-one ratio between hours played and goals possible to achieve.

Personal goals are set by each player on their own based on whatever makes sense for their character. They can be changed after each session, or whenever the player and gamemaster agree that they should be changed. Personal goals often end up being more specific than shared goals-- especially when you're still feeling out your character --but they should evolve overtime into something generic that reliably cuts to the core of your character.

Early goals like these:

* Gain a point of potential if you protected Wren from the brigands
* Gain a point of potential if you take a thieves guild job
* Gain a point of potential if you talk your way into the art show

Can become these:

* Gain a point of potential if you put yourself in harms way to protect another
* Gain a point of potential if you skimmed a little off the top for yourself
* Gain a point of potential if you convinced someone to see it your way

## Abilities

Every **10 potential you earn** (spent or not) you increase your maximum ability points by two.

<br/>

## Milestones

Milestones are significant power boosts. Usually, you'll get a milestone at the end of significant story arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. Milestones should probably happen about every 25 points of potential earned so players don't feel like they are bumping their heads on the ceiling with regards to advancement.

Whenever you achieve a milestone:

*   Increase your **dice** by 1
*   Get 12 points to increase your [attributes](../character/attributes.md).

Just like at [character creation](../getting_started/creation.md), you cannot spend more than **3** of these points on any one attribute, and must spend at least **1** on each.

Then, choose **one**:

* Increase your [health](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 6 and your maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 9
* Increase your [health](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 12 and your maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 6
* Increase your [health](../character/damage_and_injuries.md) by 18 and your maximum [ability points](../character/abilities.md#costs-and-ability-points) by 3

In addition to the power bump, milestones also provide a space for you and your gamemaster to check-in and rework any aspects of the character that just aren't working. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Forget any number of skills, and reclaim your spent potential
* Rename any number of skills
* Invest any unspent potential on any skills you want
* Combine any number of d12 skills into backgrounds
* Rename any backgrounds you want
* Erase any abilities you want, and reclaim your spent maximum ability points
* Gain any number of new abilities, spending 1 maximum ability point for each
* Improve abilities any number of times, spending 2 maximum ability points for each
