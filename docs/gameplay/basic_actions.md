# Basic Actions

Everybody can perform basic actions, but how they do them may look different depending on what way [makes sense](../getting_started/#narrative-truth) for the character!

## <i class="ra ra-crossed-swords"></i> Attack

Attacking is a [test](tests.md) of whatever attribute makes sense for the attack, usually against the roll of somebody who is defending against you! If your target cannot or does not defend, the difficulty is their passive brawn. If your target isn't a character and doesn't have passive brawn, you're actually probably [making progress](#make-progress).

When you test an attribute to **attack someone**, if you...

*   **Fail:** Your target either takes half damage or no damage at all, depending on how well the defender rolled.
*   **Partially succeed:** Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to your roll.
*   **Fully succeed:** Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to your roll.
*   **Critically Succeed:**  Your target [takes damage](../character/health.md) equal to twice your roll. 

## <i class="fa-solid fa-shield"></i> Defend

If somebody attacks you, you can try to defend against the attack and turn it into a contest of their attack roll and whatever attribute you're defending with. You can also defend against an attack targeted at someone else as long as it [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth), but you will take any damage they would have taken. 

When you test an attribute to **defend against an attack**, If you...

* **Fail:** You take damage equal to the attacker's roll, or equal to double the attacker's roll depending on how well they rolled.
* **Partially succeed:**  You take half of the attacker's roll as [damage](../character/health.md).
* **Fully succeed:** You take half of what the attacker rolled as [damage](../character/health.md).
* **Critically succeed:** You take no damage.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Get Answers

If you're trying to **answers to questions**, whether it's by researching an ancient ritual, investigating a crime scene, or getting answers out of a particularly slippery individual, make a [test](../gameplay/tests.md) of the appropriate attribute and then ask the GM (or the other player, if you're targeting a PC) some questions.

When you test an attribute to **find answers to questions**, if you...

*   **Fail:** You may ask two questions which may be answered either truthfully or falsely
*   **Partially succeed:** You may ask two questions which must be answered truthfully
*   **Succeed:** You may ask three questions which must be answered truthfully
*   **Critically Succeed:** You may ask four questions which must be answered truthfully

If you're not sure what to ask, **"What questions should I ask?"** is always a good question. It counts towards the number of questions you get, but hones in on the juicy stuff your GM might have for you to discover. It's also realistic-- it's not often that a character knows what question they're trying to answer right when they start looking for information.

The answers to the questions should both make sense and should be as complete as possible given the information at the character's disposal. An investigator looking at the scene of a murder might not be able to answer the question **"Who killed this person?"** with the name of the killer, but they could answer that question with **"someone with red hair and a blue cloak"** based on a strand of hair grasped in the victim's hand and a scrap of cloth found wedged in the door nearby.

Questions cannot be wasted. If the answer to a question was already stated, it doesn't count. If the answer to a question would not normally require a test to uncover, it doesn't count. If a question is not answerable by the information available in the context of the test, it doesn't count and the person asked the question should explain why it is not answerable and how to make it answerable, if possible.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> Help / Hinder

If you want to help somebody out, get yourself into a better position, or hinder an enemy, you can do that by rolling and stacking or unstacking dice based on the result.

When you test an attribute to **help or hinder someone**, for every **10** in the total you rolled you may:

* Stack a die or in their favor
* Remove a die stacked against them
* Stack a die against them
* Remove a die stacked in their favor

The dice you stack depends on what level you are:

* **Level 1-2**: Stack d4s
* **Level 3-4**: Stack d6s
* **Level 5-6**: Stack d8s
* **Level 7-8**: Stack d10s
* **Level 9+:** Stack d12s

## <i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> Make Progress (On Something Big)

If you're trying to do something and you can't do it in just one test, your GM may say that the goal of your test is to fill a [progress meter](../running_the_game/creating_tests.md#progress-meters) in how close the task is to being done!

When you test an attribute to **fill a progress meter**, fill it by the amount that you rolled!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-person-walking"></i> Move

Move a short distrance to get where you need to go. You may need to [test an attribute](#test-an-attribute) to get there if it's hard or dangerous to get to.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> Prepare

When a character takes some downtime and makes a test of any attribute with a goal to **prepare for a situation**, stack a flashback die. Then, for every **20** in the total you rolled, you may stack another flashback die.

The dice you stack depends on what level you are:

* **Level 1-2**: Stack d4s
* **Level 3-4**: Stack d6s
* **Level 5-6**: Stack d8s
* **Level 7-8**: Stack d10s
* **Level 9+:** Stack d12s

## <i class="ra ra-diamonds-card"></i> Test an Attribute

When you test an attribute and none of the other basic moves make sense, if you...

* **Fail:** You don't get what you want and you might be in trouble.
* **Partially succeed:** You get what you want, but there's a complication.
* **Fully succeed:** You get exactly what you want.
* **Critically succeed:** Not only do you get what you want, you get something extra!
