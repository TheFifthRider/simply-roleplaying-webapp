# Chases

**Chases** are action scenes best suited for when characters are competing to reach a particular **goal**. A necromancer flees as the tide turns against his undead minions, an archeologist braves the ocean to be first to reach an ancient tomb, a spy dashes through the hangar towards their getaway starship fueled for takeoff. 

A footrace across the room may be over in a matter of seconds, a car chase across the interstate may take hours, and chasing across countries might even take days. Whatever the scope of the chase, each participant in a chase has a **position** that is described by their distance from the goal in spaces.

## Teams

Whenever it makes sense, you can team up with other characters to act like one participant in a chase. You can leave a team at any point in a round before your team takes a turn, or join a team at any point in a round before you've taken your turn. While in a team, all of you share a position and can only take actions or have initiative passed to you as a team. Tests of ability performed by a team are performed by whichever member of the team [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth) while the other members of the team provide [assistance](tests.md#assisting).

## Acting in a Chase

There are a few special actions you can take if you're part of a chase; you can **perform a stunt** to take a risk to get closer faster, you can **create an obstacle** to slow down other participants, and you can **create a shortcut** to speed up other participants.

### Performing a Stunt

<img height=80px width=80px src="/icons/perform_stunt.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 120px;">If you want to **perform a stunt** to try to get to the goal faster, describe what you want to do to your gamemaster and together decide on what you're risking and how many actions it will take to attempt the stunt. Stunts are complicated, so you should have to spend at least two actions on them. Then, your gamemaster will have you make a [test of ability](tests.md) to see if you can pull it off.

If you...

*   **Fail,** the stunt goes wrong in some way. Move your speed towards the goal and suffer whatever risk you were taking.
*   **Partially succeed,** you succeeded! But only barely. You suffer some of what you were risking for the test, but for each action spent on the stunt, move your speed towards the goal. Then move your speed towards the goal once more for free.
*   **Fully succeeds,** you pull off your stunt and catapult yourself forward. For each action spent on the stunt, move twice your speed towards the goal.
*   **Critically succeeds,** your stunt is wildly successful. For each action spent on the stunt, move twice your speed towards the goal. Then move twice your speed towards the goal once more for free.

### Creating an Obstacle or Shortcut

<img height=80px width=80px src="/icons/obstacle_shortcut.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 200px;"> If you **create an obstacle** or **create a shortcut**, you can change how many spaces away from the goal other participants are. Just like stunts, creating obstacles and shortcuts are complicated and require **at least 2 actions** to be spent on them. 

Like performing a stunt, figure out what you're risking and how many actions it will take to create the obstacle or shortcut. Then, also determine who the obstacle or shortcut will affect, based on what makes sense. Your gamemaster will then have you make a [test of ability](tests.md) to determine whether you create what you wanted.

#### Creating an Obstacle

If you...

*   **Fail,** you couldn't create the obstacle. Your actions are wasted and you suffer the risk of the test.
*   **Partially succeed,** you created the obstacle, but it wasn't as good as you imagined. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal to represent the obstacle's delay and you suffer some risk from the test.
*   **Fully succeed,** you created the obstacle in exactly the way you hoped you would. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal for each action spent on the obstacle.
*   **Critically succeed,** you created a particularly hindering obstacle. All affected participants are moved five spaces away from the goal for each action spent on the obstacle. Then they are moved a further five spaces away from the goal.

#### Creating a Shortcut

If you...

*   **Fail,** you couldn't create the shortcut. Your actions are wasted and you suffer the risk of the test.
*   **Partially succeed,** you created the shortcut, but it wasn't as good as you imagined. All affected participants are moved five spaces action towards the goal to represent the time saved by the shortcut and you suffer some risk from the test.
*   **Fully succeed,** you created the shortcut in exactly the way you hoped you would. All affected participants are moved five spaces towards from the goal for each action spent on the shortcut.
*   **Critically succeed,** the shortcut was created and is particularly effective. All affected participants are moved five spaces towards  the goal for each action spent on the obstacle. Then they are moved a further five spaces towards the goal.

## Shaking Pursuit

If you find yourself in a chase where you're attempting to shake your pursuers, your position is the goal of the chase. Any actions you take that would move you towards the goal instead move all of your pursuers that many spaces away. The chase ends when it makes sense to, usually after you've put a certain amount of spaces between yourself and your pursuers.
