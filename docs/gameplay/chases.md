# Chases

A necromancer flees as the tide turns against his undead minions, an archeologist braves the ocean to be first to reach an ancient tomb, a spy dashes through the hangar towards their getaway starship fueled for takeoff. **Chases** are action scenarios best suited for when participants are competing to reach a particular **goal**.

A footrace across the room may be over in a matter of seconds, a car chase across the interstate may take hours, and chasing across countries might even take days. Whatever the scope of the chase, each participant in a chase has a **position** that is described by their distance from the goal in actions.

<br/>

## Teams

Characters can form into teams, together acting as one participant in the chase. Teams share their position and can work together to take actions. Tests of ability performed by a team are performed by whichever member of the team [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth) while the other members of the team provide [assistance](tests.md#assisting). The downside is that they also share a turn and as a team get three actions. Characters can leave a team at any point in a round before their team takes a turn, entering the action scenario as if they were a new participant, or join a team at any point in around before their character takes a turn. If a team ever just has one participant, that participant must leave the team and enter the action scenario as if they were a new participant.

## Acting in a Chase

When in a chase, there are a few special actions available to its participants: **closing** to progress towards the goal, **performing a stunt** to take a risk to get closer faster, **creating an obstacle** to slow down other participants, and **creating a shortcut** to speed up other participants. A character can always spend their actions on doing other things, however as always the gamemaster must rule that the action makes sense in the context.

<br/>

### Closing

<img height=80px width=80px src="/icons/close.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">A character who uses an action to **close** decreases their distance to the goal by one action. This represents doing whatever is necessary to get closer to the goal, be it kicking down a door, running across a room, or speeding down the highway.

<br/>

### Performing a Stunt

<img height=80px width=80px src="/icons/perform_stunt.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 120px;">A character who uses their action to **perform a stunt** takes a risk to try to get to the goal faster. Stunts are complicated, so they take **at least 2 actions** to perform. Based on the stunt described, the player can wager a number of actions as the cost of the stunt-- based on the number of actions it takes and the action described, the gamemaster will then devise a [test of ability](tests.md) to determine what is necessary to successfully pull off the stunt. 

If the character...

*   **Fails,** the stunt goes wrong in some way. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test.
*   **Partially succeeds,** their stunt is successful, but not as efficient as it could have been. They move towards the goal with the same number of actions that they spent on the stunt, then move towards the goal by a further action. They also suffer some risk from the test.
*   **Fully succeeds,** their stunt is fully successful. They move towards the goal a number of actions equal to twice the number of actions they spent on the stunt and will effectively minimize the risk from the test.
*   **Critically succeeds,** their stunt is wildly successful. They move towards the goal a number of actions equal to twice the number of actions they spent on the stunt, then move 2 further actions towards the goal.

### Creating an Obstacle or Shortcut

<img height=80px width=80px src="/icons/obstacle_shortcut.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 200px;"> A character who uses their actions to **create an obstacle** or **create a shortcut** chooses to not move closer to the goal, but rather change the chase for other participants. Just like stunts, creating obstacles and shortcuts are complicated and require **at least 2 actions** to perform. 

Based on what makes sense, the gamemaster will determine who in the chase is affected by the obstacle or shortcut. Like performing a stunt, the character wagers a number of actions that this obstacle or shortcut is worth and the gamemaster establishes a [test of ability](tests.md) to determine whether the creation of the obstacle or shortcut is successful or not.

#### Creating an Obstacle

If the character...

*   **Fails,** the obstacle could not be created. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test.
*   **Partially succeeds,** the obstacle was created, but offers only marginal benefit. All affected participants are moved 1 action away from the goal to represent the obstacle's delay and the character suffers some risk from the test.
*   **Fully succeeds,** the obstacle was created successfully. All affected participants are moved a number of actions away from the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the obstacle.
*   **Critically succeeds,** the obstacle was particularly effective. All affected participants are moved a number of actions away from the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the obstacle plus 1.

#### Creating a Shortcut

If the character...

*   **Fails,** the shortcut could not be created. Their actions are wasted and they suffer the risk of the test.
*   **Partially succeeds,** the shortcut was created, but offers only marginal benefit. All affected participants are moved 1 action towards the goal to represent the time saved by the shortcut and the character suffers some risk from the test.
*   **Fully succeeds,** the shortcut was created successfully. All affected participants are moved a number of actions towards the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the shortcut.
*   **Critically succeeds,** the shortcut was created and is particularly effective. All affected participants are moved a number of actions towards the goal equal to the number of actions spent on the shortcut plus 1.

## Shaking Pursuit

Sometimes, a chase will be initiated by pursuit. While usually the pursued character is fleeing to somewhere (in which case, a typical chase towards a goal is appropriate), occasionally the pursued character's goal is simply to shake their pursuers. In this case, the pursued character's position is considered to be the goal of the chase and any actions that the pursued character takes that would move them towards the goal instead move all their pursuers that many actions away.
