# Stacks of Dice

**Dice stacks** are a stack of **dice** of the same size with a **name** that describes them. Dice are either **stacked in your favor**, which means you can roll them to improve your rolls or defenses, or they are **stacked against you**, which means other people can use them to improve their rolls against you. Just like with [skills and backgrounds](../character/backgrounds.md), the name of the stack is how you determine if it makes sense that you can take some dice from it.

<br/>

## How do you stack dice?

You can stack dice by making a test with the goal of . Your GM might also stack dice when it [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth); automatically stacking dice for somebody when they start an action scene with the upper hand, or against somebody when they wade into a sucking bog. And of course, things that come with their own rules like [abilities](../character/abilities.md) or [equipment](../character/equipment.md) may stack dice for or against people.

<br/>

## How do you use them?

When you take dice off of a stack, you can either roll them to improve your roll for a [test](tests.md), or you can roll them to increase the difficulty of a test for somebody else. There's no limit to the number of dice that you can take from these stacks, as long as it [makes sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth) that the stack would help you out on your test or make the other person's test more difficult.

<br/>

## How long do they last?

When the last die is taken from a stack, the stack is gone. If you had dice stacked against you, you have either recovered from the disadvantageous situation or figured out how to deal with it. If you had dice stacked in your favor, your tactical advantage might be no longer applicable or might simply no longer provide the benefits it once did.

Your GM may also clear stacks whenever they no longer [make sense](../getting_started/index.md#narrative-truth). Being pinned down by covering fire only makes sense for as long as there's somebody out there actively raining down bullets on you-- if they get taken out or have to focus their attention elsewhere, that stack should go away.

## Examples

**2d6 Inspirational Bravery** is stacked in favor of the inspired and can be used whenever they could benefit from steeling their will.

**4d10 Seeing Shadows** is stacked against the afflicted and could be used by anyone who wants to use a character's hallucinations against them.

**3d12 Cover behind the Parapets** is stacked in favor of anyone behind the stone fortifications and could be used to defend against arrows and other dangers.

**6d4 Waist Deep in Sewage** is stacked against the hapless wader, and could be used by monsters lurking under the water or a sniper taking advantage of the character's slowed movements.

<br/>

## Special Stacks

Stacks, especially stacks created by [abilities](../character/abilities.md) or [equipment](../character/equipment.md), can also have special rules associated with them. Here are some examples:

**4d6 On Fire**: At the start of your turn, remove a die from the stack and roll it to see how much damage you take from the flames.

**3d12 Trapped by Rocks**: You can't move until all the dice have been removed from this stack.

**1d10 Berserker's Rage**: As long as this stack is around, add another die to the stack whenever you take damage.

There are no hard and fast rules on making special stacks, but most stacks probably shouldn't be special. Not only would making lots of stacks special mean lots of rules that everybody needs to remember, special stacks used in moderation give flair to specialized equipment (such as magic items, incendiary devices, or poisons) and powerful character [abilities](../character/abilities.md) that wouldn't feel as awesome if being a special stack were more common.
