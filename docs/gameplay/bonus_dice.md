# Bonus Dice

If you're fired up, tactically informed, or your teammate put you into a good position, you can draw on those benefits to gain bonus dice. Similarly, if your guard got broken, sand got kicked in your eyes, or you're pinned down by sniper fire, other people might have bonus dice against you. **Bonus dice** are a pool of **dice** of the same size with a **name** that describes them. Just like with [skills and backgrounds](../character/backgrounds.md), the name of the bonus is how you determine if it makes sense that you can take some dice from it.

<br/>

## How do they get created?

Bonus dice can be created to represent any situation in which a character either has the upper hand or is vulnerable; especially to represent the hazards or tactical benefits of the environment. In game, the bonus dice are often created by an action that a character might perform-- ducking behind cover, striking someone with a poisoned weapon, or wading into a swamp. In addition, [abilities](../character/abilities.md) or [equipment](../character/equipment.md) may specify that they create pools of bonus dice.

## How do you use them?

Bonus dice are what they sound like-- extra dice that you can roll on top of the normal amount you'd roll [whenever you roll for a test](tests.md#Resolving-Tests). You can take dice from a bonus dice pool whenever it makes sense that the bonus is working in your favor! There's no limit to the number of bonus dice that you can benefit from, which means you can use bonus dice to do things that otherwise would be impossible.

<br/>

## How long do they last?

When the last die is taken from a pool of bonus dice, it disappears. The character afflicted by the disadvantage imposed on them has either recovered from it or figured out how to deal with it. The tactical advantage acquired is no longer applicable or just doesn't provide the benefits it once did.

However, bonus dice should also go away whenever it makes sense that they should. If somebody does something to try to get rid of your bonus dice their action takes dice away from it. If something happened to make the bonus no longer applicable -- say the person who was pinning you down with suppressing fire getting taken out -- that's also a reason for the bonus dice pool to go away.

## Examples

**2d6** bonus dice called **Inspired by Bravery** could be used up to twice by those inspired.

**4d10** bonus dice on a character called **Seeing Shadows** could be used up to four times by anyone who wants to use a character's hallucinations against them.

**3d12** bonus dice called **Cover behind the Parapets** could be used up to three times by anyone who could avoid danger behind the stone fortifications.

**6d4** bonus dice on a character called **Waist Deep in Sewage** could be used up to six times by monsters lurking under the water or a sniper taking advantage of the character's slowed movements.

## Special Bonus Dice

All bonus dice can be used as described above, but they can also be customized along the same lines as [abilities](../character/abilities.md). Being _On Fire_ could absolutely mean a pool of dice that people can draw from to take advantage of, but we can also represent the damage of the flames.  Perhaps at the start of their turn, or whenever the GM feels is appropriate if you're not in an action scene, the burning character might need to remove one of the bonus dice from the pool and take damage equal to a roll of that die.

There are no hard and fast rules on customizing bonus dice, but a good rule of thumb for gamemasters is not to give every set of bonus dice special rules. Aside from the complexity it adds, customizing bonus dice make them feel special-- They give flair to specialized equipment (such as magic items, incendiary devices, or poisons) and powerful character [abilities](../character/abilities.md). If you spread that around too much, it'll start to feel like that's how all bonus dice should work.
