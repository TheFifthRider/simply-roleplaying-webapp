# Action Scenarios
When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, the timing of when each character can do what is critically important. **Action scenarios** are so named because they are the stuff that action movies are full of. Action scenarios are turn based and typically follow the same rules, however some types of action scenarios may define special things you can do with your actions that fit the theme of the scenario.

## Who Goes When

Action scenarios are turn based and take place over blocks of time referred to as **rounds**. A full round usually is considered to take ten seconds of game time, but gamemasters may adjust this based on what makes sense for the action scenario. Most of the time, each character involved in the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking a **turn** in a specific order.

<br/>

### Initiative Order

There are several ways of determining the character order in rounds, the most iconic in tabletop games is rolling for initiative and acting in an order based on that role. To act in **Initiative Order**, at the beginning of the action scenario each participant is involved in a [competition of Intuition][../basics/tests.md#Competitions], then take their turns in the order they are ranked. Keep track of the results made for this competition.

After all characters have taken their turn (otherwise known as the **end of the round**), characters outside of the action scenario can make their own roll for the competition of Inutition, and are added to the initiative order in the position determined by their roll.

#### Initiative Order: Delaying your turn

Sometimes a character will wish to take their turn at a later time. Perhaps the room has filled with smoke and they're waiting for a clear shot, or the enemy mage is about to cast a spell and they want to wait out the attack. In whatever case this might be, the character may choose to **delay their turn** until a later time in the round. 

Before any character with a lower initiative score takes their turn, the delayed character may take their turn. If more than one character are delaying their turns at the same time, each character is given the opportunity to take their delayed turn in initiative order. If a character is delaying their turn at the end of the round, they are given one final opportunity to take their turn. Delayed turns cannot carry over between rounds.

### Elective Action Order

_The following is adapted from the ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post [Accidentally Designing Marvelâ€™s Action Order System](http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2012/02/marvel/)._

**Elective Action Order** allows for a more teamwork-centric and tactical approach to initiative order by giving each character the ability to determine who acts after them.

Just like in initiative order, each participant takes part in a [competition of Intuition][../basics/tests.md#Competitions]. However, unlike in initiative order, instead of ordering participants from highest roll to lowest roll, the highest roller is declared the first to act. In the case of an ambush, tensions broken by the first shot fired, or some other situation where it is clear who will (or has) acted first gamemasters may opt to skip rolling and instead start the turn order with that character.

Then, after each participant finishes their turn, they choose another participant who has not taken a turn yet this round to be the next to take their turn. If another character interrupts the turn order the chosen character does not take their turn. Instead, the interrupting character may take their turn if they have not already done so in this round, then choose the next participant to act.

Once all participants in a round have taken their turn, characters who are not participants in the combat can become participants. Then, the last participant to take a turn in the round chooses the participant starts the next round.

#### Elective Action Order in Practice

Gamemasters, if you intend to use Elective Action Order you should be aware of its tactical advantages and disadvantages. One question you will likely be asked immediately is "why would I ever pass to an enemy?" The answer here lies in vying for control of the end of the round, since the decides the order of the next round. Used cleverly, this can allow key players or even the entire team the opportunity to take two uninterrupted turns in a row-- one at the end of the round, and one at the start of the next round.

In addition, making sure that the enemies of the combat are clearly distinct so your players can easily identify who they are choosing to go next. If you have a bunch of largely indistinguishable non-player characters, consider clearly defining squads of those non-player characters. Squads are simply made up of characters that will always pass their action to another character in their "squad" until none are available. this helps your players (and you!) so the turn can be passed to "the bandits" instead of needing to specify which specific bandit they're referring to.

<br/>

## Actions

On their turn each character can take **up to 3 actions**. One **action** on its own can be used to do something quick that does not require much complex thought. Running a short distance, making an attack, jumping a gap, climbing a ladder, hiding behind a pillar, or triggering a mechanism are all examples of actions.

### Moving Your Speed

Every character (and some objects) have a **speed**. When a character uses their action to move, they can move a distance up to their speed. This movement might be sprinting, running and leaping, swimming, riding a horse, or driving a car. Obviously, not all distances are made equal-- if something about the distance you're crossing requires you to **slow down**, you only can move up to half of your speed with that action.

### Spending Multiple Actions

A character can spend multiple actions in succession to do something complicated or time consuming. Casting a spell, repairing broken machinery, deciphering a complicated message, rolling a boulder out of the way, or hacking a computer terminal are examples of things that might take multiple actions.

If the character does not have enough actions to do something completely, they can still spend what actions they have towards the total cost of whatever they want to do. Until the full cost is paid, they are considered to be **focusing** on it. If they use an action to do anything else, their progress is lost.

If it makes sense, a character who is focusing on doing something can be helped by other characters on their turns, allowing the group to speed up the process of doing something particularly complicated or time consuming by working together.



<br/>

## Reactions

In addition to the actions that they can perform on their turn, characters can also **react** to another character's action, performing one action in response. Characters can only react once per round. If they do not react by the start of their next turn, they may perform **one extra action** on that turn. Some examples of reactions are ducking behind cover, dodging away from a fatal blow, closing a door, or activating a simple mechanism.

<br/>

## Defining Scenario-Specific Actions: Chases

Sometimes it can be helpful to define specific actions that can be taken in an action scenario if they better serve the feeling of the scenario. Chases, for instace, are a special kind of action scenario that capture the fast back-and-forth between participants in a race. Unlike other action scenarios, there's no reacting in chases. In addition, there are several special actions that can be performed in a chase, [detailed here](chases.md).

## Freeform Action Scenarios

The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when observing strict rules for an action scenario would get in the way of the drama of the scene. A **freeform scenario** is any scenario that uses some, but not all, rules that are normally a part of an action scenario. There may or may not be any defined actions or even an established turn order. This allows each character the freedom to act as would make sense to the scenario.
