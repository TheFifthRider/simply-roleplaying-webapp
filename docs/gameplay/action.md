# Action Scenes
When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, it really matters when you can do what. **Action scenes** are exactly what they sound like -- fast paced moments that you might see in an action movie or video game. While in movies or video games, action scenes are often fast paced and happen in real time, Action scenarios are turn based to allow players their space to contribute to the narrative. There are some things that are broadly applicable to all kinds of action scenarios, but sometimes you may want to slightly tweak those rules to better convey the feeling of different types of scenes -- a battle will feel differently from a chase, for instance.

<br/>

## Who Goes When

Since they're usually taking place in a short duration of time, action scenarios almost always take place over blocks of time called **rounds** that last 10 seconds, though your gamemaster may adjust that time. Everyone and everything that impacts the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking **turns**, from each of the involved characters to dangerous hazards.

### Taking Turns

_The following is adapted from the ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post [Accidentally Designing Marvelâ€™s Action Order System](https://fate-srd.com/odds-ends/elective-action-order) which has since been removed -- linked is a reprint of the post in the FATE SRD._

The first round of the action scene, figure out who made the first move. Almost every chase starts with someone bolting and almost every battle starts with someone firing the first shot. Whatever that action was, play it out and let them take the rest of their turn if they still have more to do.

Then, after the first person to go has finished their turn, they must choose another character or obstacle in the scene who has not taken a turn yet this round to take the next turn. This includes characters who so far haven't contributed to the action scene, introducing them to the fray. If there's nobody left who hasn't taken a turn yet this round, congratulations! You're the last person in the round and you get the strategic advantage of being able to pick anybody in the scene to start the next one.

### Who do I pass to?

GMs, one question you will likely be asked immediately is "why would I ever pass to an enemy?" The answer here lies in vying for control of the end of the round, since the decides the order of the next round. Used cleverly, this can allow key players or even the entire team the opportunity to take two uninterrupted turns in a row-- one at the end of the round, and one at the start of the next round.

In addition, making sure that the enemies of the combat are clearly distinct so your players can easily identify who they are choosing to go next. If you have a bunch of largely indistinguishable non-player characters, consider clearly defining squads of those non-player characters. Squads are simply made up of characters that will always pass their action to another character in their "squad" until none are available. this helps your players (and you!) so the turn can be passed to "the bandits" instead of needing to specify which specific bandit they're referring to.

### Interrupting Turns

If you have an [ability](../character/abilities.md) that lets you do it you can interrupt the turn order, taking your turn in place of whomever was originally being passed to. If you do, at the end of your turn you may choose whomever you want to take their turn next -- you don't have to pass the turn order on to the person who was originally going to take their turn.

### Alternative Ordering

You may be familiar with "rolling for initiative," in which every player rolls dice and then takes turns from highest to lowest roll. If you want to, you can absolutely do the same in Simply Roleplaying, but this "popcorn order" is strongly recommended.

<br/>

## Actions

When it's your turn, you may take **up to 3 actions**. One **action** on its own can be used to do something quick that does not require much complex thought. Running a short distance, making an attack, jumping a gap, climbing a ladder, hiding behind a pillar, or triggering a mechanism are all examples of actions.

### Moving Your Speed

Every character (and some objects) have a **speed**, measured in spaces. When a character uses their action to move, they can move a distance up to their speed. This movement might be sprinting, running and leaping, swimming, riding a horse, or driving a car. Obviously, not all distances are made equal-- if something about the distance you're crossing requires you to slow down, you only can move up to half of your speed with that action.

### Spending Multiple Actions

A character can spend multiple actions in succession to do something complicated or time consuming. Casting a spell, repairing broken machinery, deciphering a complicated message, rolling a boulder out of the way, or hacking a computer terminal are examples of things that might take multiple actions.

If the character does not have enough actions to do something completely, they can still spend what actions they have towards the total cost of whatever they want to do. Until the full cost is paid, they are considered to be **focusing** on it. If they use an action to do anything else, their progress is lost.

If it makes sense, a character who is focusing on doing something can be helped by other characters on their turns, allowing the group to speed up the process of doing something particularly complicated or time consuming by working together.

## Reactions

In addition to the actions that they can perform on their turn, characters can also **react** to another character's action, performing one action in response. Characters can only react once per round. If they do not react by the start of their next turn, they may perform **one extra action** on that turn. Some examples of reactions are ducking behind cover, dodging away from a fatal blow, closing a door, or activating a simple mechanism.

## Defining Scenario-Specific Actions: Chases

Sometimes it can be helpful to define specific actions that can be taken in an action scene if they better serve the feeling of the scenario. Chases, for instace, are a special kind of action scene that capture the fast back-and-forth between participants in a race. Unlike other action scenarios, there's no reacting in chases. In addition, there are several special actions that can be performed in a chase, [detailed here](chases.md).

## Freeform Action Scenarios

The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when observing strict rules for an action scene would get in the way of the drama of the scene. A **freeform action scene** is any action scene that uses some, but not all, rules that are normally a part of an action scene. There may or may not be any defined actions or even an established turn order. This allows each character the freedom to act as would make sense to the scene.
