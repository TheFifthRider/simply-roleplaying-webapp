# Testing Abilities
When you try to do something and there's drama involved with whether or not you can do what you try to do, your gamemaster will ask you to "test" the attribute that makes the most sense for the situation. 

When they do, you'll look at your [skills, legacies, and backgrounds](../character/backgrounds.md) and pick whichever feel appropriate to the situation. However, you can't pick more dice than your level plus the attribute you're testing.

!!! note
    Maximum dice on a test =  Your level + Attribute

Once you've gathered those dice, you roll them, add them together, and tell your gamemaster what the final result is. They will compare that number against the **difficulty** of the test, 

Your gamemaster will then inform you if you failed or succeeded, and to what degree you succeeded. They might say you fail, partially succeed, fully succeed, or critically succeed at the test.

If you didn't meet the difficulty, you **fail**. You won't get what you want and you might be in trouble. If you beat the difficulty, you **partially succeed**. You get what you want, but with some complication. If you beat the difficulty by 10 or more, you **fully succeed**. you get exactly what you want. If you beat the difficulty by 20 or more, you **critically succeed**! Not only do you get what you want, you get all that and more.

!!! note
    | Situation | Test Result |
    |-|-|
    | Difficulty beats roll | Fail |
    | Roll meets or beats Difficulty |  Partial success |
    | Roll beats Difficulty by 10 | Full Success |
    | Roll beats Difficulty by 20 | Critical Success |

## Assisting

Before you roll the dice, anybody else who can reasonably use one of their skills, legacies, or backgrounds to help you may offer their assistance by choosing the appropriate die and rolling it with you. Everybody who does so adds their roll to your own, but also either introduce a new risk to the test or somehow worsen the existing risk, making failure all the more dangerous.

If the initial risk was a deadly pitfall, the assisting character could be at risk of falling in as well. If the initial risk was taking too long to researching an antidote before the poison took hold, the additional minds involved worsen that risk to accidentally making the poison more lethal.


## Visualizing Tests
You don't usually need to write out a test and its outcomes, but if you if you did it would look something like this:

>  **Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant**<br/>
>  _Difficulty **15** Test of **Presence**_
>  ****
>  **Goal:** Turning a profit on contraband<br/>
>  **Drama:** The merchant might be insulted or involve the authorities
>  ****
>  If they...
>  
>  * **Fail:** the merchant gets indignant and starts making a scene. The authorities are sure to get involved immediately.
>  * **Partially succeed:** the merchant agrees to buy the contraband, but it seems like they're not likely to want to see you again. They may tip off the authorities, but not until after you've left.
>  * **Fully succeed:** you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal
>  * **Critically succeed:** not only does the merchant accept the deal but they happen to know a great fence in the area and look forward to working with you again


## Example of a Test

Let's bring it all together and walk through a test of ability using the **Sell Questionable Goods to a Local Merchant** example above:

> A thief character attempts to _turn a profit on some contraband_. Since this is an action that carries the risk of _the merchant becoming upset or involving the authorities_ and some uncertainty between which of the goal and the risk will occur, the gamemaster calls for a test of ability.
>
> Given the social nature of the action, the gamemaster says that convincing the merchant is going to be a test of _Presence_ and secretly marks down a difficulty of _15_, since they rule that this requires professional expertise.
>
> On the thief's character sheet are the backgrounds _Smuggler_ and _Mercenary_, as well as the skills, _Acrobatics_, _Lockpicking_, and _Intimidation_. Based on their current goal, they choose their background _Smuggler_, and their skill _Intimidation_ as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation.
>
> The gamemaster agrees that these are good choices, so the thief rolls their 1d10 Presence, 1d6 Intimidation, and 1d12 for their Smuggler background.
>
> They roll a 10, a 5, and a 5 for a total of 20--  a spectacular roll. They have a +5 attribute modifier to their Presence, bringing the total of the roll up to 25.
>
> The difficulty of the test was _15_, and 25 is 10 higher than the difficulty, which makes it a _full success_. According to the test, _you win them over or they don't seem to notice this time-- the merchant accepts the deal_. Based on the skills used, the gamemaster now has everything they need to paint a picture of how the sweating merchant responds to the smuggler's intimidation and ultimately gives in.

<br/>

## Picking the Difficulty
So how does your GM choose the specific number that you roll against? Just like characters, tests have levels, and the total difficulty of any test is equal to 5 times the test's level.

!!! note
    Test difficulty = Test level * 5

To start with, you'll likely be facing tests at the same level as you. However, as you gather strong [equipment](../character/equipment.md) and learn powerful [abilities](../character/abilities.md), you'll start facing even more difficult tests. It's not uncommon for high level characters to be facing tests of twice their level!

<br/>

### Competitions
However, not all tests have a level-- it's also perfectly valid for a test to be a roll off between the involved characters. Take an arm wrestling contest with, for example -- it would be a test of brawn, and both players would roll against each other. The outcome of the test, then, comes from comparing the rolls rather than comparing the roll to a static number.

In the rare event of a tie in a competition, everybody involved in the tie will either fail or partially succeed, depending on what makes sense to your gamemaster.

When you're dealing with three or more people involved in the same competition, it's probably best to abandon the idea of failing or succeeding entirely. Instead, judge how characters did by ranking them from highest to lowest roll.

<br/>

## Offer Hard Choices when there are Multiple Risks

Lots of tests may have multiple risks involved. Chasing after a bad guy through a crowded alley in an unfamiliar city might have both the risk of letting them get away and getting lost in a part of town you don't know. Gamemasters, while it's perfectly reasonable for a failure on a test to mean "all of the bad stuff that could happen, does happen" consider also offering hard choices to your players on which bad stuff might happen when they fail or partially succeed.

<br/>

## Good Tests

A test of ability is fundamentally useless without a **goal**, a **risk**, and an **uncertainty**. Without uncertainty, the narrative already clearly indicates what will happen, so it should just happen. Without a goal, the roller's agency is subverted-- if they don't know what they're trying to do, the number rolled doesn't mean anything to them. Without a risk, failure has no cost and the test is drained of tension. At best, it's boring-- at worst it's frustrating.

This is not to say that tests need always be dramatic or life-changing-- changing the lettering of a sign to prank a party member is as valid a goal as crossing a precarious bridge. Getting caught in the middle of defacing a street sign is still a risk, it's just a less obvious one than tumbling off of that precarious bridge.

The concept of goals and risks is something that relies on the players being immersed in their character, their surroundings, and the world at large. If you're playing with a bunch of people new to the system, take some time in an introductory dungeon to help your players think in terms of the goals they want to perform and the risks that might come with them.

<br/>

### Goal Guidelines

Goals are a statement of intent and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. Gamemasters, this is the part of skill checks that fall on the players to define. You should be prepared to ask questions until you are absolutely certain of the intention of the player's actions. If a player doesn't know what they are trying to do in the situation, the gamemaster should present some options like you might find in a choose-your-own-adventure novel.

<br/>

### Risk Guidelines

Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as taking a chainsaw to the chest, and should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night or missing a crucial detail.
