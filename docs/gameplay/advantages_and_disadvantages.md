# Advantages and Disadvantages

Sometimes characters have a leg up; they have access to an **advantage**. This could be because they're fired up, tactically informed, or their teammate put them in a good position. Other times, characters are vulnerable; they're at a **disadvantage**. Maybe their guard got broken, sand got kicked in their eyes, or they're pinned down by sniper fire.

<br/>

## What are they?

All advantages and disadvantages are a number of **dice** of the same size with a **name** that describes them. Just like with [skills and backgrounds](../character/skills.md), the name of the advantage or disadvantage is how you determine if it makes sense that you can benefit from it. When you can benefit from the advantage or disadvantage, you can take dice off of the advantage or disadvantage to get a bonus.

<br/>

## How do they get created?

Advantages and disadvantages can be created to represent any situation in which a character either has the upper hand or is vulnerable; especially to represent the hazards or tactical benefits of the environment. In game, the advantage or disadvantage is often created by an action that a character might perform-- ducking behind cover, striking someone with a poisoned weapon, or wading into a swamp. In addition, [abilities](../character/abilities.md) or [equipment](../character/equipment.md) often have specific advantages and disadvantages they create, with specific rules for how they might be created.

<br/>

## How do you use them?

Advantages and disadvantages give you extra dice on top of the normal amount you'd roll [whenever you roll for a test](tests.md#Resolving-Tests). You can take a die from an **advantage** whenever you can benefit from the described advantage. You can take a die from someone else's **disadvantage** whenever you can use the described disadvantage against them.

There's no limit to the number of advantages and disadvantages that you can benefit from, but you typically can only take one die from each applicable advantage or disadvantage per roll. The most common exception to this rule is when an [ability](../character/abilities.md) says otherwise.

<br/>

## How long do they last?

When the last die is taken from an advantage or disadvantage, it disappears. The character afflicted by the disadvantage has either recovered from it or figured out how to deal with it. The advantage is no longer applicable or just doesn't provide the benefits it once did.

However, an advantage or disadvantage should also go away whenever it makes sense that it should. This is especially true of advantages and disadvantages that are related to the environment that a character is in. It doesn't matter how good the cover was, the minute you move out from behind it any benefit it provided you is gone.

<br/>

## Examples

A **2d6** advantage called **Inspired by Bravery** could be used twice by those inspired to gain an extra 1d6 on a roll.

A **4d10** disadvantage called **Seeing Shadows** could be used four times by anyone who wants to use a character's hallucinations against them to gain an extra 1d10 on a roll.

A **3d8** advantage called **Cover behind the Parapets** can be used three times by anyone who could avoid danger behind the stone fortifications.

A **6d4** disadvantage on a character called **Waist Deep in Sewage** could be used six times by monsters lurking under the water or a sniper taking advantage of the character's slowed movements to get an extra 1d4.

<br/>

## Special Advantages and Disadvantages

All advantages and disadvantages can be used as described above, but they can also be customized along the same lines as [abilities](../character/abilities.md). Being _On Fire_ is absolutely a disadvantage, but if you wanted to represent the damage of the flames the burning character might need to take one of the dice off of the disadvantage and take damage equal to the number they roll on it.

There are no hard and fast rules on customizing Advantages and Disadvantages, but a good rule of thumb for gamemasters is not to give every Advantage and Disadvantage special rules. Aside from the complexity it adds, customizing Advantages and Disadvantages make them feel special-- They give flair to specialized equipment (such as magic items, incendiary devices, or poisons) and powerful character [abilities](../character/abilities.md).
