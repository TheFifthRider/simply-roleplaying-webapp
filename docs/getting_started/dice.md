# Some basics

Before you dive straight into Simply Roleplaying, there are a few common mechanics in the system to understand.

## Dice Size

In Simply Roleplaying, the four sided die (1d4), six sided die (1d6), eight sided die (1d8), ten sided die (1d10), and twelve sided die (1d12) are the most commonly used dice. Usually, you progress from 1d4 to 1d6 to 1d8 and so on. For this reason, Simply Roleplaying uses a tabletop roleplaying concept where the dice are described by **size**-- the more sides the die has, the "bigger" it's considered to be.

Generally, dice size is used to compare dice. A d10 is bigger than a d8 and a d4 is smaller than a d6. Sometimes in Simply Roleplaying a rule will refer to "the next biggest"  or "the next smallest" size of a die. In that case, just remember that unless the rule says otherwise, dice can only be 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, or 1d12-- there is no die bigger than 1d12 or smaller than 1d4.

## Narrative Truth

Sometimes the rules of Simply Roleplaying will say that something happens "when it makes sense." This is a simple way of saying "when the story we're telling together says it should happen." Certainly a character would heal from their wounds after some downtime recovering, but they might also heal from a healing spring that cures all wounds.

Generally what "makes sense" is obvious. When it's not obvious, what makes sense should be a conversation between players and the gamemaster.
