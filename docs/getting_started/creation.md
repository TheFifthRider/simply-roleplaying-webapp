# Creating a Character

Character creation is a player-focused activity, so this section will assume that the person reading it is a player. That said, gamemasters, you should read this as well-- it might even be good to read it aloud to your players at the table.

Creating a character is all about dreaming up a concept, then figuring out how to realize it mechanically. There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character. If you're new to roleplaying games in general, you may want to start by writing an answer to each of the headings before you read the text under them.

## What comes naturally to you?

Your starting speed is 3m. This measures the amount of distance you can travel in a few seconds-- the length of [an action](../gameplay/action.md#moving-your-speed).

In addition, all characters have intrinsic attributes about them that make it easier or harder for them to do specific things. [Read up on attributes](../character/attributes.md), then choose either to **rank your attributes** or **spend creation points**.

If you chose to **rank your attributes**, order your attributes from what your character should be best at to what your character should be worst at. Set your best attribute to d12 and your second best attribute to d10. Then set your worst attribute to d4, and your second worst attribute to d6. Finally, set the remaining two attributes to d8.

If you chose to **spend creation points**, you get a pool of 12 creation points to spend on the starting size of your attributes. A d4 is 0 points, a d6 is 1 point, a d8 is 2 points, a d10 is 3 points, and a d12 is 4 points.

### How much stress can you handle?

Once you've done that, it's time to calculate the maximum amount of damage your character can sustain. Read up on [damage](../character/damage_and_injuries.md), then calculate your **health** by adding twelve to the highest possible value you can roll on your character's brawn die.

`Health = 12 + Best possible roll on brawn die`

## What is your story?

Think about where in the campaign world you come from, and why you are seeking out to adventure with your fellow players. Then, [read up on skills and backgrounds](../character/skills.md), then choose to either **make a background** or **start brimming with potential**.

If you chose to **make a background**, write a background that summarizes your character's story so far.

If you chose to **start brimming with potential**, your gamemaster will allot you with a starting pool of 15 points of potential to spend on skills as you progress.

_Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish, just make sure you always offer 15 points of potential per background should a player opt to not make a background._

## What do you have with you?

Think about what possessions your character might have and write them down. This doesn't have to be an exhaustive list, but it should probably cover most things that you'd use to showcase what cool stuff your character can do. 

From bedrolls to mp3 players, what a character might carry with them in their day-to-day speaks a lot to who they are and where they come from. Consider writing down a sentimental object such as a an old, handwritten journal or a locket carrying an irreplaceable lock of grey hair.

Once you've finished figuring out what you've got, read up on [equipment](../character/equipment.md) and add equipment tags to anything that would benefit from having them. Be sure to talk to your gamemaster about the equipment and tags you've chosen. If your campaign is going to be combat focused, it's probably a good idea to have something with the Weapon tag and something with the Armor tag.

### Examples

A cavern explorer might have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, and a grappling hook (close-range).

A starship diplomat might have things like a universal translator, fine clothes, id card, hologram computer, a wax seal kit, and a handful of fountain pens.

<br/>

## What makes you unique?

[Read up on abilities and ability points,](../character/abilities.md) and consider what type of ability points make sense for your character. Then work with your GM to pick or create an ability for your character.

Once you've done that, choose one:

*   Give yourself another ability without reducing your ability points (or add a point to your ability points)
*   Pick something cool and unique to have as equipment-- something useful or mysterious that most people wouldn't have
*   Create a helper or ally [companion](character/companions.md) to assist your character

<br/>

## What do you look like?

Describe your character! What's their heritage? Are they young or old?  Thick or scrawny? What color skin? Eyes? Hair? What colors of clothing do they wear? How does their equipment look on them? Is it shiny and new? Dingy and poorly cared for? Ill fitting? Tailor-made? Be sure to pick a defining visual characteristic or two that highlights their history or personality.

<br/>

## What is your name?

Now that you know everything about them, what kind of a name fits your character? Do they use their full name or a nickname? Do they know their family name? Are they proud of it?

Alternatively, you can choose a name early and use that to help figure out answers to other questions!
