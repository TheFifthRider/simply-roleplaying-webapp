# Using Magic
<!-- TODO: This is largely good, but when we finish combat changes we should look into this -->

*The Simply Magic module is an optional ruleset for a GM to add Magic or other Extranormal abilities to their campaign. Consult your GM to make sure that you are using magic rules from this module!*

Unlike in many tabletop RPGs, magic is not a list of predetermined spells with various effects. Instead, in the Simply Magic module of the Simply Roleplaying system magic is the ability of the caster to reshape reality, from manipulating the thoughts of others to sending a bolt of fire streaking through the air. Because of this, magic is described by what it manipulates. Much like how the Simply Roleplaying system describes a Zwiehander as a Large Slashing weapon, a staff from which a mage produces flame would be described as Large Fire catalyst here.

## Catalysts
Harnessing magical power is exceptionally difficult to do and requires a substantial amount of time, focus, and mental preparedness from the user. In the heat of combat and on the spur of the moment, magic users often do not have the time nor mental aptitude to instantly be able to put themselves into that mindset. In order to combat that difficulty, it is common practice for a magician to use an object specifically crafted to be a conduit to magical energy, called a "catalyst." These objects are no simple matter to create, and though some cultures use the creation of such an object as a "coming-of-age" ritual, typically these objects would be bought or sold similar to weapons. It is often impractical for the crafter to make and sell one catalyst for each of the myriad types of magic. To avoid this,  most crafters will instead create the catalyst in a "blank" state that is receptive to all forms of magic and sell that. A magician could then take this blank catalyst and spend a few hours with it to attune it to their particular type of magic.

Catalysts, just like weapons, come in one of three sizes. Small catalysts tend to be insignificant in size and are also designed to be particularly easy for the caster to use, so that their caster might be able to use multiple at once. However, due to their ease of use and general size, small cataylsts cannot channel the same amount of power, and are individually not able to do as many things with whatever magic they may be attuned to. Large catalysts, on the other hand, cannot be used in tandem with other catalysts, but have a significant amount more power and flexibility than small catalysts. Medium catalysts lie somewhere in the middle of the road, striking a balance between the ability to wield multiple styles of magic and being proficiently powerful in each. Catalysts follow many of the rules of physical weapons for their respective sizes, but use the rules of magic described here to determine their accuracy, potency, and damage. Spells conjured in general work like ranged weapons with a set up range of 45m and a maximum range of 500m.

## Styles of Magic
Magic comes in one of three different styles: Physical - the manipulation of physical matter or forces, Mental - the manipulation of thoughts or emotions, and Covenant - magic that doesn't strictly come from the user. Each of these utilize a unique pair of stats to determine successful manipulation. For Physical magic, the combination is Intuition and Knowledge. For Mental magic, the combination is Charisma and Intuition. For Covenant magic, the combination is Knowledge and Charisma.

### Physical Magic
**Accuracy stat:** Intuition  
**Potency stat:** Knowledge

Physical magic is the art of manipulating physical matter and forces, referred to henceforth as an "element." An element can be virtually any force or form of matter. Just make sure you talk to your GameMaster to make sure they're comfortable with you choosing that element, remember that they have final say on what elements are available to be wielded in their world. Wielders of physical magic, through inner force of will and complete understanding their element's place in nature, are able to warp the very fabric of reality itself to match what they see.

Because much of physical magic is feeling the flow of the element, mages who have a high Intuition stat will have an easier time controlling the element that they manipulate and directing it where they need it to go. It is for this reason that Intuition is used as the base stat for Accuracy checks with physical magic. Due to the necessity of understanding the complexities of whatever matter they choose to manipulate, it behooves most physical magic users to have a strong Knowledge stat. This will help them hone their magic into a stronger form, and is used as the base stat for Potency checks with physical magic.

Physical magic catalysts are treated as the appropriate low power elemental damage weapon when unempowered, and the appropriate high power elemental damage weapon when empowered.

Some examples of elements that a caster might manipulate are:

* **Fire**, from lighting torches to raging bonfire
* **Metal**, iron, steel, brass and  lead all bend for you like clay
* **Magnetism**, how does it work?
* **Smoke**,  choking clouds of cinders
* **Electricity**, call down the wrath of the skies

### Mental Magic
**Accuracy stat:** Charisma  
**Potency stat:** Intuition

Mental magic is the art of the caster imposing their will upon others, specifically in a way so as to manipulate a specific emotion or aspect of the target's personality, henceforth referred to as a "mental trait." When manipulating an emotion, the mage can exaggerate or reduce its significance but it's important to note that a mental mage cannot cause someone to feel the inverse of their emotion. A mage who specializes in Happiness mental magic could reduce their targets happiness to virtually nothing, but they cannot use that power to make them feel sad. Though such sudden changes in mental traits may be a clear tell that a novice caster is messing with your mind, an adept mental magician will be subtle enough to force their target to reconcile their sudden change. Be sure to talk to your GameMaster about which mental trait you wish to manipulate to confirm that it's okay with them.

Charisma, a stat used to measure the force of the Caster's will, is extremely important for any mental mage to use if they are to impose their will upon others. It is for this reason that Charisma is used as the base stat for Accuracy checks with mental magic. However, though a strong will is paramount to manipulate another's mind, it is equally important to have finesse with mental magic. Most individuals can shake impulsive thoughts that they can reason against, so it is important for a mental magic user to carefully link the sudden change in the targetted trait to logical sources. Doing so proficiently will enable the mental magicians changes to stay in place for longer and requires a high Intuition stat. For this reason, Intuition is used as the base stat for Potency checks with mental magic.

Some examples of traits that a caster might manipulate are:

* **Fear**, the amount of times one picks flight over fight
* **Happiness**, the amount of enjoyment derived from activities
* **Agreeableness**, the openness to new ideas or suggestions
* **Neuroticism**, how prone to negative emotions someone might be
* **Extraversion**, how outgoing or sociable an individual might be

### Covenant Magic
**Accuracy stat:** Knowledge  
**Potency stat:** Charisma

Covenant magic is the art of a magician making a pact with one or more other magical entities in order to share power and accomplish feats beyond just themselves. This network of power is referred to as a Covenant, and is invariably founded by a group of individuals who hold similar beliefs. Unlike with Mental and Physical magic, the caster of Covenant Magic rarely dictates everything about the form of the magic produced, instead covenant itself produces a magic that reflects the beliefs of their members through the caster. In this way, covenant magic can manifest in a form that would fall under the category of physical magic or manifest in a form that would fall under the category of mental magic. This is not to say that a caster of covenant magic does not have any say over what happens, but rather that the covenant magic itself has a bit of a will of its own. A good example of this is with the magic from the followers of Magnusancte, the god of judgement who is often heralded by brilliant light. Some examples of covenant magic from the followers of Magnusancte would be: manifesting golden shackles to lock up a prisoner, calling a bolt of lightning down to smite an unworthy wretch, and making an opponent quake in fear before the presence of Magnusancte. However since Magnusancte is considered to be such an incredibly brilliant and important god, using his powers to, say, conjure a puny globe of light to light the way into a dark room would be blasphemous and likely would not work.

Since covenant magic can only manifest in a way that represents the beliefs that it is created from, expert covenant magicians must have complete understanding of the beliefs that their covenant represents. Such understanding allows the caster to precisely manifest and utilize the magic gained from their covenant, and is the reason why Knowledge is the base stat for Accuracy checks with covenant magic. Due to the networked nature of the power granted by covenant magic, often the power is distributed based on individual need at the moment. For this reason, the stronger a will a mage has the more power that they can draw from their covenant. It is for this reason that Charisma is used as the base stat for Potency checks with covenant magic.

Covenant magic catalysts that produce physical effects are treated as the appropriate low power elemental damage weapon when unempowered, and the appropriate high power elemental damage weapon when empowered.

Some examples of covenant magicians are:

* **Followers of Magnusancte**, whose magic is brilliant and judges both the victim and the wielder
* **Paladins of the Cleansing Flame**, a covenant who work to burn evildoers. It's said their flame has no effect on the pure of heart
* **Servants of Petraxan**, the continental god from the Deus pantheon. It is said that their magic can move mountains
* **Beneficiaries of the House Floras**, whose anima, Floras, grows fruit that are said to have healing properties
* **Purple Hexadivinites**, who are said to be able to channel the power of Pureum to dispel any magic
