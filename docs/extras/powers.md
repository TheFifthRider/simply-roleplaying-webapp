# Powers

Magic is a common tool in high fantasy, superhero fiction, and science fiction-- it goes by different names depending on your exact setting, but the rules presented here should work for anything from magic spells to super powers to psionics. They're all forms of extranormal **powers**.

<br/>

## What can Powers Do?

By their very nature, powers almost always allow their wielder to do things that would otherwise be impossible. Creating flame from nothing, communicating over vast distances, or teleportation are all things that are typically accomplishable with the right powers. Powers, just like anything else that a character can do, should require a [test of ability](../gameplay/tests.md) to use.

Powers are usually described by the [skills](../character/skills.md) required to wield them; a _pyromancy_ skill would allow the wielder to manipulate fire, a _telepathy_ skill would allow them to speak into the minds of others, and a _gravitational manipulation_ skill would let them manipulate gravity. 

### Naming Skills Tied to Powers

Unless your setting encourages particularly broad skills, your gamemaster may want you to avoid more ambiguously named skills like _magic_ or _super-powers_ and instead focus on specifics. A good rule of thumb is to think of a particular thing to have power over and use that as the description of the skill. Your gamemaster should be able to help you figure out what a good skill would be to represent the power you want in their setting.

## What Limits Powers?

Even if powers can do the impossible, they likely cannot do _every_ impossible thing, beyond even the limitations imposed by the nature of your powers. 

Most powers have [risks](../gameplay/tests.md#risk-guidelines). The power may have chance of going wrong or be strenuous to use, meaning the very act of using those powers in a test may have their own negative consequences. For powers with risks, the scale of what the power is being used to do usually increases the scale of the risk. Levitating a pebble might be easy with some concentration where levitating a boulder would be exhausting and levitating a mountain might kill you if you tried.

Here's an example of implementing a risk of exhaustion into a strenuous use of power:

>   **Growing a Tree with Nature Magic**
>
>   _Difficulty **30** Test of **Knowledge**_
>
>   ****
>
>   **Goal:** Growing a tree from a sapling to a fully grown oak
>
>   **Risk:** Expediting life takes its toll, exhausting you
>
>   ****
>
>   If they...
>
>   * **Fail:** the tree may grow, but it takes far more energy than you expected. Take **30** damage from the toll of your magic.
>   * **Partially succeed:** the tree grows, but it drains your energy to do so. Take **15** damage from the toll of your magic.
>   * **Fully succeed:** you coax life to grow faster than it normally would, growing the sapling to a mighty oak
>   * **Critically succeed:** not only does the tree grow, it flourishes for years to come.

## Powers and Equipment

Many pieces of [equipment](../character/equipment.md) can be used to help with [tests of ability](../gameplay/tests.md). With powers, that equipment may also allow them to perform greater feats or skip over certain requirements. Magicians might have wands, cauldrons, or spellbooks. Superheroes might have rings, hammers, or gadgets. Psionics might have emitters, inhibitors, or focusing helmets. Any equipment with the tag [focus](../character/equipment.md#focus) and tagged with one or more [extranormal powers](../character/equipment.md#extranormal-power) is considered to be a piece of equipment that allows the wielder to use that particular power.

Just like with any other piece of equipment, focuses have an attribute tag to determine which attribute you use to exert your power. Usually this is a mental attribute. Intuition focuses might be used for powers dealing with the slippery minds of others. Knowledge focuses might be used for powers manifesting elemental forces, and Will focuses might be used for manifesting power borrowed from a covenant or divinity.

### Using Powers without Equipment

<!-- TODO: Update when we get abilities -->

Some powers may be usable without equipment, this usually increases the risks associated with those powers. Of course, when a character has a particular **ability** to use a power without equipment that's a different story. (**Abilities coming soon**)

<br/>

## Example Powers

Some powers that a character might use their **Knowledge** for are:

* **Pyromancy**, from lighting torches to raging bonfire
* **Telekinesis**, moving stuff with your mind
* **Metal bending**, iron, steel, brass and lead all bend for you like clay
* **Magnetism manipulation**, how does it work?

Some powers that a character might use their **Intuition** for are:

* **Fear manipulation**, the amount of times one picks flight over fight
* **Telepathy**, the ability to convey thoughts into the minds of others
* **Scrying**, the ability to see distant people and places
* **Mind reading**, the ability to pluck thoughts from the minds of others

Some covenants and divinities that a character might use their **Will** to manifest miracles from are:

* **Magnusancte**, whose brilliant magic judges both the target and the wielder
* **Bloodfrost**, the art of the Thorns of the Red Ringed Rose that can only be conjured by inflicting suffering upon oneself
* **Floras**, the anima of a grove of trees with healing fruits
* **Pureum**, the Hexadivinite lady of the purple robe, whose chaotic nature can be used to dispel magic
