# Milestones

Milestones are markers of when the player characters advance and are awarded to celebrate the significant things the players have accomplished over the course of the game. Typically, a milestone is only awarded once per session and at the end of the session, but gamemasters can award more than one milestone per session and/or milestones in the middle of the session if it seems appropriate.



## Every Milestone

Every milestone earns the character some amount of potential, varying based on the significance of what happened in the campaign. This is ultimately up to the gamemaster to determine, but about one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is usually right for an average session.



## Special Milestones

Special milestones typically occur at the end of significant arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. Special milestones tend to grant a big chunk of potential and some other added benefit, based on the type of special milestone. A few types of special milestone are defined below.

Gamemasters, a good rule of thumb is to aim to give a special milestone about every 20 to 30 potential earned, and to grant roughly a session and a half's worth of potential when you do so. If you use milestone goals, this should happen more or less naturally as special milestones tend to come after sessions that have players check all the boxes. If it doesn't come naturally, feel free to come up with additional milestone goals for accomplishing significant arcs, defeating significant foes, or whatever best suits your campaign. The goal of milestone goals is to feel good about the concrete things you have done in the game world.



### Skill Milestones

In [skill checks](/character/skills/), characters start only being able to add one skill or background to the check. Skill milestones are special milestones which increase. While there is no upper bound to the number of skill milestones a character can achieve, it's rare for a character to earn more than three.



### Stat Milestones

Stat milestones are special milestones in which each [stat modifier](/character/stats/) is increased. One milestone increases by 5, one by 4, one by 3, one by 2, and one by 1. Your GM may impose an upper bound on how high you can increase the modifier based on the actual physical capabilities of your character-- this is usually somewhere around +15.



## Checklists and Goals

An interactive way of determining how many points of potential to earn at the end of a session is by setting milestone goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with "Gain a point of potential if we..."-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential. The easiest way to represent this is with an end-of-session checklist featuring the goals

Here's a sample end-of-session checklist featuring a few example goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session.

* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we accomplished something new and important
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about the world
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about one of the player characters

* [ ] Increase each stat modifier by 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 / 1 if this milestone is a stat milestone
* [ ] Increase the number of dice you add to a skill check if this milestone is a skill milestone
