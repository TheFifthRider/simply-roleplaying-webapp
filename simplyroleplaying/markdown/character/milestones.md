# Advancement

Typically, a milestone is only awarded once per session and at the end of the session, but gamemasters can award more than one milestone per session and/or milestones in the middle of the session if it seems appropriate.



## Every Session

At the end of every session, a character earns some amount of potential, varying based on the significance of what happened in the campaign. This is ultimately up to the gamemaster to determine, but about one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is usually right for an average session.



## Milestones

Milestones are markers of when the player characters advance and are awarded to celebrate the significant things the players have accomplished over the course of the game. Milestones typically occur at the end of significant arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. Whenever character's achieve special milestones, they are awarded a larger than average amount of potential, a boost to their [stamina](/character/stamina_and_injuries), and some other added benefit, based on the type of special milestone. A few types of special milestone are defined below.



### Every Milestone

Every milestone, a character's [stamina](/character/stamina_and_injuries) increases by 5 plus their brawn modifier. If it's an attribute milestone, they gain additional stamina for each point of increase to their brawn modifier equal to the number of milestones they have earned before this one.



### Skill Milestones

In [tests of ability](/character/tests/), characters start only being able to add one skill or background to the test. Skill milestones are special milestones which increase the number of skills or backgrounds that can be added to a test by one. While there is no upper bound to the number of skill milestones a character can achieve, it's rare for a character to earn more than three.



### Attribute Milestones

Attribute milestones are special milestones in which each [attribute modifier](/character/attributes/) is increased. The modifier of two attributes each increase by 3, two more attribute modifiers increase by 2, and your final two attribute modifiers increase by 1 to a maximum of +15. Your GM may alter the maximum as it suits your campaign.



### When to give Milestones

This section is largely for gamemasters, players you can skip it if you'd like. A good rule of thumb for awarding milestones  is to give a milestone about every 10 to 12 potential earned, and to grant roughly a session and a half's worth of potential when you do so. If you use session goals, this should happen more or less naturally as special milestones tend to come after sessions that have players check all the boxes. If it doesn't come naturally, feel free to come up with additional milestone goals for accomplishing significant arcs, defeating significant foes, or whatever best suits your campaign. Whatever you choose, milestone goals should be about celebrating the accomplishments of the player characters and the story you are all weaving together.



## Checklists and Goals

An interactive way of determining how many points of potential to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with "Gain a point of potential if we..."-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential. The easiest way to represent this is with an end-of-session checklist featuring the goals

Here's a sample end-of-session checklist featuring a few example goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session.

* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we accomplished something new and important
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about the world
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about one of the player characters

* [ ] Increase your stamina by 5 + your brawn modifier if this is a milestone
* [ ] Increase your attribute modifiers if this is an attribute milestone-- two by 3, two by 2, and two by 1
	* [ ] Increase your stamina by the number of milestones you have earned before this one for each increase to your brawn modifier
* [ ] Increase the number of dice you add to a skill check if this is a skill milestone
