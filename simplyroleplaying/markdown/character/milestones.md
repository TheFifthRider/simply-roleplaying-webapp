# Advancement

## Every Session

At the end of every session, a character earns some amount of potential, varying based on the significance of what happened in the campaign. This is ultimately up to the gamemaster to determine, but about one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is usually right for an average session.



## Milestones

Milestones are markers of when the player characters advance and are awarded to celebrate the significant things the players have accomplished over the course of the game. Milestones typically occur at the end of significant arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. Whenever character's achieve milestones, they are awarded a larger than average amount of potential, their attribute modifiers increase, and they get to add one additional die to tests of ability.

* Increase your <!-- test pool? number of dice you can use on tests? --> by 1
* Choose two attributes and increase their modifiers by 4, then: 
  * If you chose agility as one of these attributes, gain <!-- movement speed? -->
  * If you chose brawn as one of these attributes, gain 25 [stamina](/character/stamina_and_injuries)
  * If you chose intuition as one of these attributes, gain <!-- passive bonus? -->
  * If you chose knowledge as one of these attributes, gain <!-- ??? -->
  * If you chose presence as one of these attributes,  gain <!-- ??? -->
  * If you chose will as one of these attributes, gain an [injury box](/character/stamina_and_injuries)
* Choose two more attributes and increase their modifiers by 3
* Increase the modifiers for your final two attributes by 2



### When to give Milestones

This section is largely for gamemasters, players you can skip it if you'd like. A good rule of thumb for awarding milestones is to give a milestone about every 25 potential earned, and to grant roughly two session's worth of potential when you do so.

If you use session goals, this should happen more or less naturally as milestones tend to come after sessions that have players check all the boxes. If it doesn't come naturally, feel free to come up with additional session goals for accomplishing significant arcs, defeating significant foes, or whatever best suits your campaign. Whatever you choose, session goals should be about celebrating the accomplishments of the player characters and the story you are all weaving together.



## Checklists and Goals

An interactive way of determining how many points of potential to earn at the end of a session is by setting session goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with "Gain a point of potential if we..."-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential.

Here are some end-of-session goals that should work for most campaigns assuming a four hour session, along with the milestone instructions in checklist form.



### At the end of a session:

* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by

* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we accomplished something new and important

* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about the world

* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about one of the player characters

  

### When a milestone is achieved:

* [ ] Increase your <!-- ??? --> by 1
* [ ] Increase two attribute modifiers by 5, then:
  * [ ] Gain <!-- ??? --> if one of the attributes was agility
  * [ ] Increase your maximum stamina by 25 if one of the attributes was brawn
  * [ ] Gain <!-- ??? --> if one of the attributes was intuition
  * [ ] Gain <!-- ??? --> if one of the attributes was knowledge
  * [ ] Gain an injury box if one of the attributes was will
* [ ] Increase two attribute modifiers by 4
* [ ] Increase two attribute modifiers by 3
