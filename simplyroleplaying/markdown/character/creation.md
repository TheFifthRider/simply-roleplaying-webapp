# Creating a Character

Character creation is intrinsically a player-focused activity, so this section will assume that the person reading it is a player. That said, gamemasters, you should read this as well-- it might even be good to read it aloud to your players at the table.

Creating a character is all about dreaming up a concept, then figuring out how to realize it mechanically. There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character. If you're new to roleplaying games in general, consider writing a quick answer to the questions below as you build your character.



## What are your natural abilities?
All characters have intrinsic attributes about them that make it easier or harder for them to do specific things. [Read up on attributes](/character/attributes/), then choose either to **rank your attributes** or **spend creation points**.

If you chose to **rank your attributes**, order your attributes from what your character should be best at to what your character should be worst at. Set your best attribute to level d12 and your second best attribute to level d10. Then set your worst attribute to level d4, and your second worst attribute to level d6. Finally, set the remaining two attributes to level d8.

If you chose to **spend creation points**, you get a pool of 12 creation points to spend on the starting die levels of your attributes. A d4 is 0 points, a d6 is 1 point, a d8 is 2 points, a d10 is 3 points, and a d12 is 4 points.



## What have you learned?

Everyone has a variety of abilities that they have learned over time through practice. [Read up on skills and backgrounds](/character/skills/), then choose to either **make a background** or **start brimming with potential**.

If you chose to **make a background**, write a background that summarizes the skills your character has learned so far.

If you chose to **start brimming with potential**, your gamemaster will allot you with a starting pool of 25 points of potential to spend on skills as you progress.

_Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish, just make sure you always offer 25 points of potential per background should a player opt to not make a background._



## What is your story?

Motivations and experiences define characters in ways that no natural or learned ability possibly could. Each player should consider where in the campaign world they come from, and why they are seeking out to adventure with their fellow players. [Read up on advantages and disadvantages](/character/advantages_and_disadvantages/) and pick a few to help develop your character's history further.

A character can have any amount of Advantages and Disadvantages so long as the total ranks of character's advantages is equal to the total ranks of the character's disadvantages.



## What do you have with you?

How the players determine what items their characters have with them is largely up to their gamemaster. In a typical campaign it would not be uncommon for a character to get a full set of armor, a primary weapon, an assortment of whatever things their character might have with them "on a typical day", and an assortment of items related to their current pursuits.

A tomb explorer would likely have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, a grappling hook, and other such necessities.

A starship diplomat, on the other hand, would likely have things like a universal translator, fine clothes, id card, hologram computer, a wax seal kit, a handful of fountain pens, a sheaf of paper, and other sophisticated items.

From bedrolls to mp3 players, what a character might carry with them in their day-to-day is telling of personality, circumstances of life, and so many other things. Consider also carrying an object of personal significance to your character, such as a an old, handwritten journal or a locket carrying an irreplaceable lock of grey hair.



## What do you look like?

Describe your character! What's their heritage? Are they young or old?  Thick or scrawny? What color skin? Eyes? Hair? What colors of clothing do they wear? How does their equipment look on them? Is it shiny and new? Dingy and poorly cared for? Ill fitting? Tailor-made? Be sure to pick a defining visual characteristic or two that highlights their history or personality.



## What is your name?

Now that you know everything about them, what kind of a name fits your character? Do they use their full name or a nickname? Do they know their family name? Are they proud of it?

Alternatively, you can choose a name early and use that to help figure out answers to other questions!
