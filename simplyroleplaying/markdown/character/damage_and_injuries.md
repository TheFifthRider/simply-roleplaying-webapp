# Damage and Injuries

<!-- why have health tho? -->

<!-- Tension is necessary for drama. Nothing is more exciting than overcoming an obstacle where failure would have meant death. However, death from a single obstacle is unfulfilling-- we feel cheated when a single pit of spikes skewers our hero of the past several hours in the space of ten fateful seconds, particularly if we play that hero. -->

## Damage

**Damage** is the amount of energy that a character has to handle strenuous and dangerous things. The maximum amount of damage a character can sustain is calculated based on the die level of a character's brawn die as explained in [character creation](/character) and can be increased by [milestones](/character/milestones).

Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or risk, they mark it down on their character sheet. If the total amount of damage exceeds their **maximum damage**, they take an injury and then erase all damage they've taken so far.



## Injuries

Whenever a character suffers an injury, write a brief description of the injury on one of the blank injury lines on their character sheet. **Injuries** are any lasting physical or mental consequence that requires treatment, such as a _fractured wrist_ from blocking a crushing mace blow, _exhaustion_ following an inventing all-nighter, or a _bite to the bone_ from a rat.

If a character takes an injury but has no blank injury lines, their existing wounds cause this next wound to become a **life-threatening injury**. Simply leaving this injury untreated may require [tests of brawn or will](/character/tests) from the character with the risk that the injury will worsen on its own. 



## Recovering

If a character spends at least <an hour> resting they erase all of their accumulated damage. Whenever the character spends at least <eight hours> resting, they may erase all of their injuries from their character sheet.

Characters with life-threatening injuries must have those treated before any of their wounds can be erased. What is required to treat a life-threatening injury is based on the injury received, but many require a [test of knowledge](/character/tests) to apply lifesaving medicine or bandages. Even once they've been treated, life-threatening injuries often leave trauma, a permanent scar, or a crippled limb on the character who suffered them-- a reminder of their brush with death.

From a roleplaying perspective, erasing wounds from your character sheet doesn't mean those wounds have completely healed-- just that they are healed enough that they are no longer bringing your character closer to a life-threatening injury. When a character who is still healing suffers an injury, it can sometimes be more interesting or dramatic to have the injury suffered be a once-treated injury that has worsened to the point of again being a danger.
