# Attributes

Attributes are the measurement of a character's intrinsic ability, from how strong they are to how quickly they seize up situations. Each attribute is assigned a die of a certain level at [character creation](/character/), which is rolled as a part of [tests of ability](/character/tests/). [You can learn more about die levels here](/).



## The Attributes

**Agility** is the measurement of a character's physical speed and precision. Characters with high Agility are often flexible, dexterous, and able to evade harm that comes their way.

**Brawn** is the measurement of a character's physical strength and endurance. Characters with are often strong, athletic, and resistant to maladies.

**Charisma** is a measure of a character's will and presence. Characters with high Charisma are often convincing, socially adept, and driven.

**Intuition** is a measure of a character's gut instincts. Characters with high Intuition are often observant, perceptive, and quick to react and adapt to change. 

**Knowledge** is a measure of a character's memory and problem solving. Characters with high Knowledge are able to give excellent tactical advice and are often able to solve complicated puzzles, craft sophisticated objects, and remember intricate details.



## Attribute Modifier

Over time, as a character grows and becomes more proficient at their skills, they will also naturally become stronger and sharper. **Attribute modifiers** are a bonus added to the result of a specific attribute die in [tests of ability](/character/tests/). In most campaigns they start at +0, as indicated in [character creation](/character/), and increase as you acquire [attribute milestones](/character/milestones/). 



## Passive Attribute Scores

Attributes are core to a character's ability, even when they are not consciously focusing on them. Whenever there is a risk that a character cannot consciously oppose, they use the appropriate passive score instead of rolling the dice. A characters **passive score** for an attribute is calculated as half of your best possible roll with that attribute, plus the attribute's modifier, plus the passive bonus earned from [skill milestones](/character/milestones/).

`Attribute Passive Score = half of your best possible roll + Attribute Modifier + Passive Bonus`

> As young wizard quietly tiptoes past his sleeping master, he tests his ability to swipe her fabled wand, risking getting caught red handed and getting turned into a newt _or worse_. Because she's asleep, the difficulty of the test is her passive Intuition score-- how likely her instincts are to wake her up from the noises her apprentice makes.
>
> Her intuition is a d10, her intuition modifier is +6, and her passive bonus is +5. Half of her best possible roll on a d10 is 5, so her passive intuition is 5+6+5 = 16, making the difficulty of the apprentice's test 16.
