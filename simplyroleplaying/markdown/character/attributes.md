# Attributes

Attributes are the measurement of a character's intrinsic ability, from how strong they are to how quickly they seize up situations. Each attribute is assigned a die of a certain level at [character creation](/character/), which is rolled as a part of [tests of ability](/character/tests/). [You can learn more about die levels here](/).



## The Attributes

**Agility** is the measurement of a character's physical speed and precision. Characters with high Agility are often dexterous, flexible, and swift.

**Brawn** is the measurement of a character's physical strength and endurance. Characters with high Brawn are often strong, athletic, and resistant to maladies.

**Intuition** is a measure of a character's gut instincts. Characters with high Intuition are often observant, perceptive, and quick to react and adapt to change. 

**Knowledge** is a measure of a character's memory and problem solving. Characters with high Knowledge are often able to solve complicated puzzles, craft sophisticated objects, and remember intricate details.

**Presence** is a measure of a character's social skills and natural charm. Characters with high Presence are often amiable, convincing, and socially adept.

**Will** is a measure of a character's drive and resolve. Characters with high Will are often determined, independent, and undeterred by hardship.



## Attribute Modifier

Over time, as a character grows and becomes more proficient at their skills, they will also naturally become stronger and sharper. **Attribute modifiers** are a bonus added to the result of a specific attribute die in [tests of ability](/character/tests/). In most campaigns they start at +0, as indicated in [character creation](/character/), and increase as you acquire [attribute milestones](/character/milestones/). 



## Passive Attribute Scores

Attributes are core to a character's ability, even when they are not consciously focusing on them. Whenever there is a risk that a character cannot consciously oppose, they use the appropriate passive score instead of rolling the dice. A characters **passive score** for an attribute is calculated as half of your best possible roll with that attribute, plus the attribute's modifier, plus the character's Intuition modifier.

`Passive Score = half of your best possible roll + Modifier + Intuition Modifier`

> A vizier tests their _Presence_ to manipulate their monarch by feeding them fabrications. Even though the monarch has no reason to suspect the vizier of lying, their extensive experience creates a difficulty of their passive _Presence_ score-- how likely they are to notice the social signs of mistruth.
>
> The monarch's _Presence_ is a d12, their _Presence_ modifier a +9, and their _Intuition_ modifier a +3. Half of their best possible roll on a d12 is 6, so their passive _Presence_, and the difficulty of the Vizier's test, is 6 + 9 + 3 = 18.



> A young wizard tries to tiptoe past their sleeping master, testing their _Agility_ to silently swipe the master's fabled wand, risking getting caught red handed and getting turned into a newt _or worse_. Because the master is asleep, the difficulty of the test is the master's passive _Intuition_ score-- how likely the master's instincts are to wake her up from the noises her apprentice makes.
>
> The master's intuition is a d10, her intuition modifier is +9. Half of her best possible roll on a d10 is 5, so her passive intuition, and the difficulty of the Apprentice's test, is 5 + 9 + 9 = 23.
