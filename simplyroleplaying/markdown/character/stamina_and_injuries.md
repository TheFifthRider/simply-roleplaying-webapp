# Stamina and Injuries

<!-- why have health tho? -->

<!-- Tension is necessary for drama. Nothing is more exciting than overcoming an obstacle where failure would have meant death. However, death from a single obstacle is unfulfilling-- we feel cheated when a single pit of spikes skewers our hero of the past several hours in the space of ten fateful seconds, particularly if we play that hero. -->

## Damage

**Damage** is the amount of energy that a character has to handle strenuous and dangerous things. The maximum amount of damage a character can sustain is calculated based on the die level of a character's brawn die as explained in [character creation](/character) and can be increased by [milestones](/character/milestones).

Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or risk, they mark it down on their character sheet. If the total amount of damage exceeds their **maximum damage**, they take an injury and then erase all damage they've taken so far.



## Injuries

**Injuries** are any lasting physical or mental consequences that a character suffers. Characters can suffer a maximum number of injuries, represented by the number of injury lines on their character sheet. Whenever a character suffers an injury, one of the lines is filled in with a brief description of the injury-- a _fractured wrist_ from blocking a crushing mace blow, _exhaustion_ following an inventing all-nighter, an _infected wound_ from a rat bite.

<!-- Avoid the FATE vagueness issue! Firmly define categories for injuries! -->

<!-- Injuries have degrees and degrees indicate how fast/slow it can heal? Having an untreated injury somehow allows it to worsen maybe? -->

<!-- r1 injuries take 1 rest until they are no longer considered an injury, r3 take 3 rests -->

Once all the lines are filled in, the next injury that the character receives is a **life-threatening injury**. Simply leaving this injury untreated may require [tests of brawn or will](/character/tests) from the character with the risk that the injury will worsen on its own. 



## Recovering

If a character spends at least an hour resting they lose all of their accumulated damage. 

Recovering from injuries, however, is harder. Before an injury can be erased off of a character sheet, they must first treat it. Treating an injury depends largely on the wound-- _exhaustion_ may simply require a night's rest to treat, but an _infected wound_ might require a [test of knowledge](/character/tests) to correctly apply a dose of medicine and clean bandages.

<!-- grades of healing supplies required to treat levels of injuries? -->

<!-- recovering from an injury does not necessarily mean it goes away, they can still leave lasting marks -->

Whenever the character spends at least four hours resting, for every four hours they spend resting they may erase one treated injury from their character sheet.
