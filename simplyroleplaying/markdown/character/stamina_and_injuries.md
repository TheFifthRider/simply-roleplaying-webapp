# Stamina and Injuries

<!-- why have health tho? -->

<!-- Tension is necessary for drama. Nothing is more exciting than overcoming an obstacle where failure would have meant death. However, death from a single obstacle is unfulfilling-- we feel cheated when a single pit of spikes skewers our hero of the past several hours in the space of ten fateful seconds, particularly if we play that hero. -->

## Stamina

**Stamina** is the amount of energy that a character has to handle strenuous and dangerous things. The amount of stamina a character has is initially calculated based on the die level of a character's brawn die as explained in [character creation](/character), then increases every [milestone](/character/milestones).

If a character's stamina is reduced to zero, they immediately lose consciousness. Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or risk, they are presented with a choice-- lose stamina equal to the damage dealt or take an injury.



## Injuries

**Injuries** are lasting consequences from risks that characters have undertaken. Injuries range from sprains and bad bruising to broken bones and horrific burns. 

Whenever a character suffers an injury, they write it down on their character sheet. A character can initially suffer 3 injuries-- the first one mild, the second one moderate, and the third one severe. Once they have suffered all possible injuries, the next injury they take will prove life threatening.

<!-- Whenever a character attempts to do something  pertaining to an injury, they must spend a die on that injury. -->



## Treating Injuries

<!-- injuries can be treated by knowledge. -->
