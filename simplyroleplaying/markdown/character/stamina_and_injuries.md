# Stamina and Injuries

<!-- why have health tho? -->

<!-- Tension is necessary for drama. Nothing is more exciting than overcoming an obstacle where failure would have meant death. However, death from a single obstacle is unfulfilling-- we feel cheated when a single pit of spikes skewers our hero of the past several hours in the space of ten fateful seconds, particularly if we play that hero. -->

## Stamina

**Stamina** is the amount of energy that a character has to handle strenuous and dangerous things. The amount of stamina a character has is initially calculated based on the die level of a character's brawn die as explained in [character creation](/character), then increases every [milestone](/character/milestones).

If a character's stamina is reduced to zero, they immediately lose consciousness. Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or risk, they are presented with a choice-- lose stamina equal to the damage dealt or recieve an injury.



## Injuries

**Injuries** are any lasting physical or mental consequences that a character might suffer. An injury could be a sprain from blocking a crushing mace blow, the lack of clarity that comes after a sleepless night of inventing, or the infection from a rat bite. 

Whenever a character suffers an injury, they write it down on their character sheet. A character can handle taking one mild injury, one moderate injury, and one serious injury. After that, the next injury they take will be a **life-threatening injury**.

<!-- Whenever a character attempts to do something  pertaining to an injury, they must spend a die on that injury. -->
