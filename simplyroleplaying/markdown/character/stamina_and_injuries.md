# Stamina and Injuries

<!-- why have health tho? -->

<!-- Tension is necessary for drama. Nothing is more exciting than overcoming an obstacle where failure would have meant death. However, death from a single obstacle is unfulfilling-- we feel cheated when a single pit of spikes skewers our hero of the past several hours in the space of ten fateful seconds, particularly if we play that hero. -->

## Stamina

**Stamina** is the amount of energy that a character has to handle strenuous and dangerous things. The amount of stamina a character has is initially calculated based on the die level of a character's brawn die as explained in [character creation](/character) and can be increased by [milestones](/character/milestones).

Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or risk, they lose stamina equal to the damage of the attack. If the amout of damage exceeds their remaining stamina, they lose the rest of their stamina and take an injury.



## Injuries

**Injuries** are any lasting physical or mental consequences that a character might suffer. 

Characters start with a maximum number of injuries represented by blank lines on their character sheet. Whenever a character suffers an injury, one of the lines is filled in with a brief description of the injury-- a _fractured wrist_ from blocking a crushing mace blow, _sleep deprevation_ following a night of inventing, an _infected wound_ from a rat bite. Once all the lines are filled in, the next injury that the character recieves becomes a **life-threatening injury**.

Injuries stay on your character sheet until they heal. To heal an injury, it must first be treated. <!-- explain treating injuries- maybe this is what degrees of injuries should be for? Grades of healing supplies here maybe? -->



## Recovering

If a character spends at least an hour resting, they regain all of their lost stamina. If they spend at least four hours resting, for every four hours they spend resting they may erase one treated injury from their character sheet.

<!-- injuries can be treated by knowledge. -->
