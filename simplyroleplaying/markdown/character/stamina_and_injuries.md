# Stamina and Injuries

<!-- why have health tho? -->

<!-- Tension is necessary for drama. Nothing is more exciting than overcoming an obstacle where failure would have meant death. However, death from a single obstacle is unfulfilling-- we feel cheated when a single pit of spikes skewers our hero of the past several hours in the space of ten fateful seconds, particularly if we play that hero. -->

## Stamina

**Stamina** is the amount of energy that a character has to do strenuous and dangerous things. 

<!-- Stamina is a health bar based on Brawn. Players should be able to take about six hits before injuries, so high stamina characters should be around 50 to start and around 200 at max level (+2 skill dice, +15 brawn) -->



## Injuries

Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or dangerous obstacle, it chips away at their stamina. If a character does not have enough stamina to weather an attack, pay for the consequences of a risk, or if a character chooses to **take the hit** instead of taking damage, they suffer an injury. **Injuries** are lasting consequences from risks that characters have undertaken. Injuries range from sprains and bad bruising to broken bones and horrific burns. 

Whenever a character suffers an injury, they write it down on their character sheet. A character can suffer <!-- some will-scaling number --> injuries at most. Once they have suffered all possible injuries, the next injury they take will prove life threatening.

<!-- Whenever a character attempts to do something  pertaining to an injury, they must spend a die on that injury. -->



## Treating Injuries

<!-- injuries can be treated by knowledge. -->
