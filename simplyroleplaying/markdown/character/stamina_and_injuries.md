# Stamina and Injuries

<!-- why have health tho? -->

<!-- Tension is necessary for drama. Nothing is more exciting than overcoming an obstacle where failure would have meant death. However, death from a single obstacle is unfulfilling-- we feel cheated when a single pit of spikes skewers our hero of the past several hours in the space of ten fateful seconds, particularly if we play that hero. -->

## Stamina

**Stamina** is the amount of energy that a character has to handle particularly strenuous and dangerous things.

If a character's stamina is reduced to zero, they immediately lose consciousness. Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or risk, they are presented with a choice-- lose stamina equal to the damage dealt or recieve an injury.

<!-- Stamina is a health bar based on Brawn. Players should be able to take about six hits before injuries, so high stamina characters should be around 50 to start and around 200 at max level (+2 skill dice, +15 brawn) -->



## Injuries

**Injuries** are any lasting physical or mental consequences that a character might suffer. An injury could be a sprain from blocking a crushing mace blow, the lack of clarity that comes after a sleepless night of inventing, or the infection from a rat bite. 

Whenever a character suffers an injury, they write it down on their character sheet. A character can handle taking one mild injury, one moderate injury, and one serious injury. After that, the next injury they take will be a **life-threatening injury**.

<!-- Whenever a character attempts to do something  pertaining to an injury, they must spend a die on that injury. -->
