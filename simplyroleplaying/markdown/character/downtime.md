# Between Adventures

Downtime is a period of rest in which a character has enough time to pursue productive ends. A period of downtime is measured in 4 hour <!-- renameMe -->s during which you can focus on the activity that you are working on and that you have the proper tools and space to work in. As downtime activities become more complex, they will have more stringent requirements.

<!-- ex: In the enchanting case, simple, temporary enchantments can be done on the road, but more permanent ones will require renting a space in a city or being somewhere that you have access to an enchanting workstation, like the temple under Hierusmont. -->

## Downtime over extended periods of time

Sometimes characters have more than four hours to work with. <!--  If you  spend a full day or an all-nighter working on something, that will advance you three "nights" of work on the project. If you pull a full day+all-nighter, you get advanced six. If you pull an all-nighter you do not sleep that night and will likely have a penalty for the following day. Multiple all-nighters in a row can lead to more serious complication -->

## Training

One <!-- renameMe --> of downtime can be spent with the proper materials to train. More details on training can be found in the section on [Skills and Backgrounds](/character/skills).

## Crafting

Crafting is an example of a downtime activity. Crafting projects have three components-- **Difficulty**, **Materials**, and **Time**.

### Time

Simply, the number of downtime periods required to complete the project. <!-- Measure of progress -- success = 2, failure = 1, crit s = 3, crit fail = 0 -->

### Difficulty

The crafting DC that you'll need to move the project forward. Succeeding at this dramatically can improve the craftsmanship. If you want, failing at this dramatically can also decrease the craftsmanship/make you trash the project, but I don't know that I want to incorporate punitive mechanics into crafting. 

### Material

Materials come in three grades -- **Common**, **Rare**, and **Legendary**.

For magic items, common materials tend to cost 1sp, Rare materials tend to cost 100sp, and legendary materials tend to be only acquirable by questing for them yourself.
