# Action Scenarios
When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, the timing of when each character can do what is critically important. The stuff of chases, escapes, and battles **action scenarios** are so named because they are the stuff thing that action movies are full of.



## Rounds

Action scenarios are turn based and take place over blocks of time referred to as **rounds**. A round often measures around ten seconds of the action, but gamemasters may vary this based on what makes sense for the action scenario. Most of the time, each character involved in the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking a **turn** in a specific order. If a character acts outside of when they would usually act in the turn order, they are considered to be **interrupting** the turn order.



### Determining the Turn Order

There are several ways of determining the character order in rounds, the most iconic in roleplaying games is **rolling for initiative**. At the beginning of the action scenario, each participant makes an Intuition roll (adding their modifier as normal) and marks the result of this value as their **initiative** for the scenario. 

Characters then take their turn in order from highest roll to lowest roll. Ties can be broken by the character's [passive intuition score](/character/attributes/), then by the die level of the Intuition attribute-- d6s beat d4s, d8s beat d6s and so forth. Further ties can be broken at GM discretion.

At the end of each round, after all characters have taken their turn, characters who join the action after the initial rolls roll for initiative and are sorted into the initiative order based on their roll.



### Alternative Rule: Elective Action Order

_The following is adapted from the ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post [Accidentally Designing Marvelâ€™s Action Order System](http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2012/02/marvel/)._

Elective Action Order allows for a more teamwork-centric and tactical approach to initiative order by giving each character the ability to determine who acts after them.

After rolling for initiative, instead of ordering participants from highest roll to lowest roll, the highest roller is declared the first to act. In the case of an ambush, tensions broken by the first shot fired, or some other situation where it is clear who will (or has) acted first gamemasters may opt to skip rolling and instead start the turn order with that character. 

Then, after each participant finishes their turn, they choose another participant who has not taken a turn yet this round to take their turn next. If another character interrupts the turn order the chosen character does not take their turn. Instead, the interrupting character may take their turn if they have not already done so in this round, then choose the next participant to act. 

Once all participants in a round have taken their turn, characters who are not participants in the combat can become participants. Then, the last participant to take a turn in the round chooses the participant starts the next round.



#### Elective Action Order in Practice

Gamemasters, if you intend to use Elective Action Order

In addition, making sure that the enemies of the combat are clearly distinct so your players can easily identify who they are choosing to go next. If you have a bunch of largely indistinguishable non-player characters, consider clearly defining squads of those non-player characters that all choose another member of their squad to go next if available-- this helps your players (and you!) so the turn can be passed to "the militia" instead of "to the militia guy-- no the one with the pitchfork."



## Types of Action Scenarios

### Freeform Scenario

The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when observing strict rules for an action scenario would get in the way of the drama of the scene. A **freeform scenario** is any scenario that uses some, but not all, rules from other action scenarios to allow each character the freedom to act as would make sense to the scenario.




### Combat Scenario

Combat scenarios are action scenarios that capture the strategy of battlefield tactics in a style familiar to most tabletop roleplaying enthusiasts. A round lasts ten seconds, and each turn allows a character to show off their capabilities by taking multiple actions in succession.

### Race Scenario

Race scenarios are action scenarios that capture the fast back-and-forth between participants in a race. A round lasts a variable amount of time, from seconds to hours, and each turn is a snapshot in that time. [You can read more about Race Scenarios here](/action/racing/).
