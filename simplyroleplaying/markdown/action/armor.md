# Armor

Armor is any defensive clothing, from personal shield generators to kevlar vests to full plate and has an attribute associated with it based on how the armor protects the character. Most armor is _brawn_ armor-- heavy and thick, augmenting the wearer's ability to take hits by reducing the impact of blows. Some armor is _agility_ armor-- light and flexible, offering protection to the wearer without sacrificing ease of movement so they can dodge away from danger. Depending on your setting, there may even be _intuition_, _knowledge_, or _charisma_ armors.

Not all armor is created equal. A squire's chain shirt and a knight's full plate might both be _brawn_ armor, but one is clearly superior to the other. To represent this, in addition to an attribute, every piece of armor has a **quality modifier** based on the craftsmanship, materials, and renown of the armor that ranges from +0 to +9.



## Calculating Armor Value

A character can only benefit from one set of armor at a time. How much the chosen armor protects a character is based on the [passive score](/character/attributes/) of the attribute the armor is associated with. The **Armor Value** (or **AV**) of the armor is calculated by adding the _quality modifier_ of the armor to the _passive score_ of the attribute associated with the armor.

The calculated AV acts as the measurement of a character's defensive capabilities, and is used as the difficulty whenever another character makes a test of ability to attack them. More details on exactly how AV is used with regards to weapon attacks is covered in the section on [weapons](/action/weapons/).



### Protection from Carried Equipment

Carried equipment that provide protection, such as shields, also have both an attribute and a quality modifier associated with them. If the armor and the defensive equipment are of the same attribute, the defensive equipment provides its quality modifier as a bonus to the character's total AV. Typically a character can only benefit from one piece of carried defensive equipment at a time.

`AV = Passive Attribute Score + Quality Modifier + Carried Protection Quality Modifier (if any)`



### Armor value when Unarmored

When a character has no armor on them, their armor value is equal to their passive agility or passive brawn, whichever is higher.
