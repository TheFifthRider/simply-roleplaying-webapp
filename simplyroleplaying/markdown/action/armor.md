# Armor

Armor is any defensive clothing, from personal shield generators to kevlar vests to full plate. All armor has an associated attribute, depending on how the armor protects the character. Most armor is Brawn armor-- heavy and thick, augmenting the wearer's ability to take hits by reducing the impact of blows. Some armor is Agility armor-- light and flexible, offering protection to the wearer without sacrificing ease of movement so they can dodge away from danger. Depending on your world's setting, there may even be Intuition, Knowledge, or Charisma armors.



## Calculating Armor Value

How much the armor protects a character is based on the appropriate [passive attribute score](/character/attributes/). **Armor Value** (or **AV**) is a number that acts as the measurement of a character's defensive capabilities, and is the difficulty whenever a character makes a test of ability to attack another character. More details on exactly how AV is used is covered on [the main combat page.](/action/combat/)



### Carried Protection

Carried items that provide protection, such as shields, are restricted like weapons-- any character can only be actively using two hands worth of items during each of their turns in combat. If one of the items that a character is wielding is a shield, they may add the shield's AV to their total AV for as long as they are wielding it. <!-- TODO: Adjust how shields work -->

Not all armor is created equal. A militia's chainmail may utilize the same brawn that a knight's platemail does, but there's no question that the platemail is sturdier than the chainmail. In Simply Roleplaying, this is represented by the armor's quality modifier. A **quality modifier** is represented by a bonus to AV, from +0 to +12.

Crafting Bonus
Crafting bonus ranges from 0 to +10, depending on the material, quality of goods, etc.
(generally, +0 to +5 craftsmanship, +0 to +5 material)

Legendary Bonus
+1  - A piece of renown (Local masterpiece)
+2  - The stuff of legends (global masterpiece)

Armor is typically associated with either agility or brawn, but it is concievable that some settings could have armor that is tied to any stat.

As a general rule, the heavier a piece of armor is, the better it protects the wearer. Armor comes in four weight classes; Improvised, Light, Moderate, and Heavy. An improvised piece of armor is just what it sounds like- any piece of armor that is thrown together or not necessarily intended to be armor would fall into this category. Examples of improvised pieces of armor would be lashing tree bark to oneself or using a briefcase as a shield. Pieces of light armor one can have a reasonable amount of dexterity in and, with practice, that shouldn't restrict the wearer's movement in any major way. Some examples of pieces of light pieces of armor are studded leather gauntlets or a kevlar vest. Pieces of armor are considered to be medium if the piece of armor restricts movement somewhat and generally weighs enough that it is laborious to move quickly in. Some examples of medium pieces of armor are chainmail or a ballistic vest. Heavy pieces of armor are notable in that they are typically the most movement-restricting but the most protective pieces of armor. Some examples of heavy pieces of armor are a suit of iron platemail or a pair of lead-lined boots.
