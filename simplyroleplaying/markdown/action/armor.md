# Armor
Defensive clothing of any kind, from personal shield generators to kevlar to platemail, are considered to be armor in the Simply Roleplaying system. Much like weapons, different characters will prefer different armors. Where strong characters may prefer heavy armor that allows them to leverage their brawn defensively, quick characters might prefer lighter armor that allow them to duck and weave with their agility. Mechanically, this means that every set of armor has an associated stat that determines the armor value when worn. **Armor Value** (or **AV**) is a number that acts as the measurement of a character's defensive capabilities, and is referenced as the number to roll against whenever a character makes a potency check to see how many wounds they inflict upon their target. More information on exactly how armor value works in combat is available on [the main combat page.](/action/combat/)

Carried items that provide protection, such as shields, are restricted like weapons-- any character can only be actively using two hands worth of items during each of their turns in combat. If one of the items that a character is wielding is a shield, they may add the shield's AV to their total AV for as long as they are wielding it. <!-- TODO: Adjust how shields work -->

Not all armor is created equal. A militia's chainmail may utilize the same brawn that a knight's platemail does, but there's no question that the platemail is sturdier than the chainmail. In Simply Roleplaying, this is represented by the armor's quality modifier. A **quality modifier** is represented by a bonus to AV, from +0 to +12.

Armor is typically associated with either agility or brawn, but it is concievable that some settings could have armor that is tied to any stat.

As a general rule, the heavier a piece of armor is, the better it protects the wearer. Armor comes in four weight classes; Improvised, Light, Moderate, and Heavy. An improvised piece of armor is just what it sounds like- any piece of armor that is thrown together or not necessarily intended to be armor would fall into this category. Examples of improvised pieces of armor would be lashing tree bark to oneself or using a briefcase as a shield. Pieces of light armor one can have a reasonable amount of dexterity in and, with practice, that shouldn't restrict the wearer's movement in any major way. Some examples of pieces of light pieces of armor are studded leather gauntlets or a kevlar vest. Pieces of armor are considered to be medium if the piece of armor restricts movement somewhat and generally weighs enough that it is laborious to move quickly in. Some examples of medium pieces of armor are chainmail or a ballistic vest. Heavy pieces of armor are notable in that they are typically the most movement-restricting but the most protective pieces of armor. Some examples of heavy pieces of armor are a suit of iron platemail or a pair of lead-lined boots.
