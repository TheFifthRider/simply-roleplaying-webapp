Boy I'd love to pitch you Simply Roleplaying, but tbh I'm still trying to figure out how to. I'll come back to this.



## Some basics

Before you dive straight into Simply Roleplaying, there are a few common mechanics in the system to understand.

### Die Levels

In Simply Roleplaying, the four sided die, six sided die, eight sided die, ten sided die, and twelve sided die are the most commonly used dice, and are typically used as a representation of different levels of ability. For this reason, Simply Roleplaying uses a concept referred to as Die Levels. **Die levels** range from 1 to 5, where level 1 represents a four sided die (1d4), level 2 represents six sided die (1d6), level 3 represents an eight sided die (1d8), and so on. The table below can be used as a reference to determine the die used based on the appropriate die level.



| Die Level | Die Used                |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| Level 1   | 1d4 (four-sided die)    |
| Level 2   | 1d6 (six-sided die)     |
| Level 3   | 1d8 (eight-sided die)   |
| Level 4   | 1d10 (ten-sided die)    |
| Level 5   | 1d12 (twelve-sided die) |
