# Weapons

Weapons are any carried equipment used to attack another character, from table legs to semi-automatic rifles. Weapons have **tags** to describe how they work. Every weapon has at least one **attribute tag** to indicate which attributes can be used to make attacks with it and at least one **range tag** to describe how far away the weapon's target can be.



## Attacking with a Weapon

Attacking with a weapon is a [test of ability](/character/tests). The attribute for the test can be any of the attributes that the weapon is tagged with, and the difficulty of the test is the [armor value](/action/armor/) of the target. Success on the test means dealing damage equal to the amount the attacker rolled, a critical success means double damage, a failure means half damage, and a critical failure means do damage at all.

As an example, here's the test for attacking an armor value 15 target using a greatsword with the tags _brawn_, _melee_, _large_, _cleaving_, and _slashing_:

>  **Attacking with a Greatsword**
>
>  _Difficulty **15** Test of **Brawn**_
>
>  ****
>
>  **Goal:** Striking the target and inflicting injury
>
>  **Risk:** Not inflicting any damage <!-- TODO: Review, what really is the risk here? Is it really just not inflicting as much damage as hoped? -->
>
>  ****
>
>  * **On a critical success:** the target [takes damage](/character/damage_and_injuries) equal to double the attacker's total for the test.
>* **On a success:** the target [takes damage](/character/damage_and_injuries) equal the attacker's total for the test.
>  * **On a failure:** the target [takes damage](/character/damage_and_injuries) equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down.
>* **On a critical failure:** the target takes no damage.

### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes, it makes sense that a character can attack with an object not intended to be a weapon or with a weapon in a way that it's not intended to be used. Examples of this could be using a table leg as a cudgel, throwing a maul, or bashing with the butt of a sniper rifle. Attacking in this way technically may violate the range or attributes tagged on the weapon, but should always be possible.

Your gamemaster may rule that **a character can use a weapon or object to attack with whatever attribute makes sense for the situation** but this improvised weapon carries an additional **risk of being damaged, destroyed, or otherwise lost** in test of ability associated with the attack. For more on risks, see [Making Good Tests](/character/tests#Making%20Good%20Tests). In addition, **the gamemaster may say that some tags on the weapon do not apply**-- bashing with the butt of a rifle, for instance, would likely not benefit from the rifle's quality tag, since the quality likely refers to how well it fires its rounds.

As an example, here's a possible test for attacking an armor value 15 target using the butt of a sniper rifle with the tags _agility_, _long-range_, _large_, and _precision_:

>  **Attacking with the Butt of a Sniper Rifle**
>
>  _Difficulty **15** Test of **Brawn**_
>
>  ****
>
>  **Goal:** Striking the target and inflicting injury
>
>  **Risk:** Not inflicting any damage, breaking or damaging the Sniper Rifle <!-- TODO: Review, what really is the risk here? Is it really just not inflicting as much damage as hoped? -->
>
>  ****
>
>  * **On a critical success:** the target [takes damage](/character/damage_and_injuries) equal to double the attacker's total for the test.
>* **On a success:** the target [takes damage](/character/damage_and_injuries) equal the attacker's total for the test.
>  * **On a failure:** the target [takes damage](/character/damage_and_injuries) equal to half of the attacker's total for the test, rounded down, and the sniper rifle jams or is otherwise unusable for a short time.
>* **On a critical failure:** the target takes no damage and the sniper rifle gets bent or broken in the scuffle and requires repairs.



## Weapon Tags

### Attribute Tags

Most historical weapons would have some combination of Agility and Brawn tags, however depending on your setting it's possible for weapons to have Intuition, Knowledge, Presence, and Will tags as well. It's not necessary for every setting to have weapons for every attribute, but both the players and the GM should be on the same page regarding which attributes are most commonly tagged on weapons in the GM's setting.

* **Agility**
  Weapons with this tag are often light, compact, and easy to swing swiftly or rely on manual precision to operate effectively. _Bows_, _scimitars_, _sniper rifles_, and _pistols_ often have the Agility tag.
* **Brawn**
  Weapons with this tag are often heavy or strenuous to operate effectively. _Mauls_, _axes_, _grenade launchers_, and _shotguns_ often have the Brawn tag.
* **Intuition**
  Weapons with this tag are often foreign or complicated in inconsistent ways, requiring keen adaptability to operate effectively. _Alien technology_ and _mental magic catalysts_ often have the Intuition tag.
* **Knowledge**
  Weapons with this tag are often exceptionally complicated, effectively operated by someone thoroughly trained in how the weapon works. _Mad science gadgets_, _ancient rituals_, and _physical magic catalysts_ often have the Knowledge tag.
* **Presence**
  Weapons with this tag might be sentient and require reasoning with to operate effectively or otherwise somehow weaponize the wielder's social aptitudes. _A high maintenance combat support robot_, _a tape recording of the maddening snores of C'thulhu_, or _an arcane book of physically manifesting insults_ might have the Presence tag. 
* **Will**
  Weapons with this tag might be painful to operate or otherwise require and amplify the mental fortitude required to get them to work. _A shard of broken glass_, _covenant magic catalysts_, and _alien biotech integrated into a human_ often have the Will tag.

### Range Tags

* **Melee**
  Weapons with this tag can be used against targets who are within arm's reach, usually around 2m away.
* **Short-range**
  Weapons with this tag can be used on targets that are outside of arm's reach but still pretty close, usually between 2 and 15m away.
* **Long-range**
  Weapons with this tag can be used on targets a long ways away, usually over 15m away.

### Other Tags

* **+1, +2, +3, ...**
  Weapons with this tag are more effective than other weapons of the same type due to exemplary craftsmanship, materials, and/or renown of the weapon. When making a test of ability to attack with this weapon, add the value tagged to the roll. 
* **Battering**
  Weapons with this tag are blunt instruments that rely on their weight to deal damage. _Batons_, _maces_, and _war picks_ often have the Battering tag.
* **Cleaving**
  Weapons with this tag have a wedge shaped blade that is swung with a chop. _Battleaxes_, _meat cleavers_, and _war picks_ often have the Cleaving tag.
* **Concealable**
  Weapons with this tag are small, easily hidden, and easy to draw subtly. _Daggers_, _miniature crossbows_, _pistols_, and _brass knuckles_ often have the Concealable tag.
* **Hooking**
  Weapons with this tag have curved blades that allow their wielder to hook onto their opponents. _Khopeshes_, _scythes_, and _sickles_ often have the Hooking tag.
* **Impaling**
  Weapons with this tag have a sharp point that is stabbed at opponents. _Bayonets_, _rapiers_, and _spears_ often have the Impaling tag.
* **Large**
  Weapons with this tag require two hands to wield effectively. _Rocket launchers_, _mauls_, _longbows_, and _staves_ often have the Large tag.
* **Payload**
  Weapons with this tag fire a heavy or explosive projectile. _Cannons_, _grenade launchers_, and _slings_ often have the Payload tag.
* **Precision**
  Weapons with this tag fire a swift shot that is deadly when placed perfectly. _Crossbows_, _semi-automatic rifles_, and _slings_ often have the Precision tag.
* **Repeating**
  Weapons in this tag fire a number of projectiles in rapid succession, bombarding their target. _Automatic rifles_, _hwachas_, and _???_ often have the Repeating tag.
* **Slashing**
  Weapons with this tag are weapons that have one or more long, sharp edges that can be used to lacerate. _Hunting knives_, _khopeshes_, and _rapiers_ often have the Slashing tag.
* **Spread**
  Weapons with this tag fire shrapnel, fire, poison, or other hazards to coat a wide area. _Cannons_, _shotguns_, and _flame-throwers_ often have the Spread tag.
