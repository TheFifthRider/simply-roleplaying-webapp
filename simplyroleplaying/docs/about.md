# About Simply Roleplaying

Simply Roleplaying started at a friend's birthday party in college. It was a small get-together, about a half dozen of us, and someone suggested a one-shot session. At the time I was running two weekly D6 Fantasy campaigns of which only a handful of people at the celebration were a part of, and I was eager to play-- there was just one problem. I didn't have any of my D6 Fantasy materials. All I had was a single set of polyhedral dice.

So I winged it. Everyone's character name was their actual name and each player distributed a d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 between five attributes: Agility, Brawn, Mental, Charisma, and Luck.
