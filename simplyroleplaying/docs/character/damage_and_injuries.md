# Damage and Injuries

## Damage

**Damage** is the amount of energy that a character has to handle strenuous and dangerous things. The maximum amount of damage a character can sustain is calculated based on the die level of a character's brawn die as explained in [character creation](/character) and can be increased by [milestones](/character/milestones).

Whenever a character suffers damage from an attack or risk, they mark it down on their character sheet. If the total amount of damage exceeds their **maximum damage**, they take an injury and then erase all damage they've taken so far.



## Injuries

**Injuries** are lasting physical or mental consequence that bring a character closer to death. Whenever a character suffers an injury erase all damage taken so far, mark an injury box and, if the line next to it is blank, write a brief description of the injury.

While the gamemaster ultimately has final say over what the injury is, any player can offer a suggestion for what kind of an injury a character may have taken. Some examples of injuries are a _fractured wrist_ from blocking a crushing mace blow, _exhaustion_ following an inventing all-nighter, or a _shoulder bite to the bone_ from a rat of unusual size.



### Dying

If a character suffers an injury but all of their injury boxes are marked, their accumulated injuries become life-threatening.   When your injuries get this bad, they tend to come with trauma, permanent scars, or crippled limbs. Mark the **dying** box on your character sheet and erase all damage you've taken so far. If a character who is dying suffers enough damage to take an injury, they die.



## Recovering

If a character spends **a short time** resting they erase all of their accumulated damage. Whenever the character spends at least **an extended period of time** resting, they may erase all marked injury boxes on their character sheets.

If the rest was enough to fully heal the injury, erase the description next to the marked injury box. Otherwise, keep it around-- recovering doesn't mean those wounds have completely healed, just that they are healed enough that they are no longer bringing your character closer to a life-threatening injury. If you need to check that injury box again, it means those wounds reopened.



### Healing

Healing is a way of expediting the process of recovery. If a character receives medical treatment for one of their injuries over **a short time** they may erase the marked injury box from their character sheet in addition to erasing all of their accumulated damage. Your gamemaster may rule that a character must have access to medical supplies appropriate for treating the injury and/or that they must make a test of knowledge to treat the injury.
