<h2 id="Animus">Animus</h2>
**Worshipper Title:** Beneficiary

**Deities in Pantheon:**

<ul class="nonbulletedlist">
	<li><strong>Lunis</strong>, one of the twin Arch-Anima that create and command the anima, also referred to as "Father Destruction"</li>
	<li><strong>Sola</strong>, one of the twin Arch-Anima that create and command the anima, also referred to as "Mother Creation"</li>
	<li><strong>Innumerable other Anima</strong></li>
</ul>

### Creation of the World
The Animus believe that the Arch-Anima are benevolent beings that created the world from lifeless scrap that existed in the universe. The Animus believe that both the universe and the Arch-Anima have always existed and always will exist, with or without their believers. The Animus pledge their lives to their "benefactors" as a sign of showing respect for the gift of life they were given.

### The End of the World
The Animus believe that the universe and the Arch-Anima will always live forever, and as such have no thoughts on the end of the world beyond the fact that some day there will not be any Animus left to worship the Arch-Anima, prompting the Arch-Anima to create new life.

### The Gods' Role in the World
The Anima believe that upon an area or grouping of people being consecrated by a priest of the Animus, a personal Anima will be created by the power of the Arch-Animi to watch over the consecrated location or individuals. Consecration is a high honor, and is typically only done if the group of people or the place is extremely important in the eyes of the Animus.

### Worship Practices
Because Anima are created for specific locations or individuals, worshiping them is simply paying respect for their job. This can be done in any way the Animus determines, but is usually accomplished through feats of labor such as creating or maintaining a shrine or preparing regular offerings. It is generally believed that the more work done to honor the spirit, the more the worship is worth.

### What Makes a Priest
Becoming a priest of Anima requires that the Animus who wishes to become a priest take a pilgrimage back to the original shrine of Sola, followed by a dangerous trek through a mountain pass to the original shrine of Lunis. At both shrines, an elder priest records the Animus' entrance and provides mentorship for the Animus. The Animus becomes a priest if they are deemed worthy by both mentors.

### The Afterlife
The Animus do not believe in life after death -- instead, they believe their souls are absorbed back into the Arch-Animus from whence they came.


<h2 id="Court of Celestials">Court of Celestials</h2>
**Worshipper Title:** Celestate

**Deities in Pantheon:**

<ul class="nonbulletedlist">
	<li><strong>The Council</strong></li>
	<ul class="nonbulletedlist">
		<li><strong>Avaria</strong>, Archangel of Justice and Trial</li>
		<li><strong>Zeriate</strong>, Archangel of Protection and Divine Retribution</li>
		<li><strong>Collete</strong>, Archangel of Ingenuity and Expression</li>
		<li><strong>Gabrielle</strong>, Archangel of Law and Order</li>
		<li><strong>Teviyas</strong>, Archangel of Good Will and Harvest</li>

	<ul class="nonbulletedlist">
		<li><strong>Lilith</strong>, Archangel of Violence and Calamity</li>
		<li><strong>Morrigan</strong>, Archangel of Temptations and Misery</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

### Creation of the World
Celestate believe that a great force called "The Light" formed the universe and nine Archangels to govern it: the Court of Celestials. However, when the creation of sentient beings began, the Court of Celestials began to disagree. Lilith and Morrigan jointly proposed the idea that the races should serve the council. Avaria and Gabrielle agreed, but were outweighed when the other Angels, championed by Serenia and Collete, rejected the proposal. Outraged, Morrigan and Lilith consorted with a powerful ancient primordial force called "The Darkness" and amassed an army of Dark Angels to attack the Celestial Terrace, where the Council resided. They lost, defeated by the joint forces of Avaria and Zeriate, and were cast out into a realm of pure Darkness known as "The Pit". Instead of being defeated by this new prison, Morrigan and Lilith adapted dark powers to manipulate the realm into the Nether Sphere, a dominion which was their own twisted world. Teviyas felt bad for her sisters and went to the Nether Sphere to implore them to rejoin the Council. Lilith and Morrigan reluctantly agreed, however, as a compromise they were allowed their "revenge" on the races, creating all manner of afflictions to test the races, that they might be worth the council's protection.

### The End of the World
The Order neither believes that any apocalypse is imminent, nor that The Darkness is completely evil. However, an offshoot known as the Templars believes Lilith and Morrigan are forming up an army in the Nether Sphere to take over the world. There are other, smaller, denominations of the Celestate who embody different interpretations of the Council's will, but they are of negligible importance. Speak to your GM if you would like to be a part of an offshoot.

### The Gods' Role in the World
The Council primarily stays out of the affairs of the world. However, each Archangel is a guardian of an important virtue, and may affect the morals and events based around these virtues.

### Worship Practices
Worshippers gather in a church and pray to the Council, singing their praises and asking for their guidance. Lilith and Morrigan are rarely worshiped, but when they are it is in an ancient, cult-like manner.

### What Makes a Priest
Priests must go through schooling in which they focus on interpreting the will of a specific Archangel.

### The Afterlife
Those who die and live a virtuous life become housed within the Council's halls, ruled over and protected by the Archangel which they most associate with. Those who do not become VoidSpawn, the mindless servants of Lilith and Morrigan. Cults of the Twin Sisters of Shadows believe that the most loyal among them will become Dark Angels through a process called "The Calling". Should they become Dark Angels in this way, they would keep their free will to more adequately serve Lilith and Morrigan.

<h2 id="Deus">Deus</h2>
**Worshipper Title:** Servant

**Deities in Pantheon:**

<ul class="nonbulletedlist">
	<li><strong>Magnempus, God of Weather</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Stelsolis, Goddess of the Celestial Bodies</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Petraxan, God of the Land</strong></li>

</ul>

### Creation of the World
The Deus believe that the world was created and the Gods born at the same time. As the world grew, so did the Gods -- for they were the world, and controlled its development. As the years rolled by, eventually they grew lonely with their power in the world and felt a wave of dissatisfaction overcome them. As the Gods grew more and more, they tried to fill the void they felt, accidently setting into motion the creation of the sentient races. Although this creation was accidental, the deities felt a new sense of purpose and responsibility and vowed to watch after this new life they created.

### The End of the World
The Deus believe that the Gods are not immortal, but rather that they simply live for an incredibly long time. When the Gods start to die, the Deus believe that the world will begin to unravel. Similarly, any harm caused to the world is seen as harm caused to the Gods themselves.

### The Gods' Role in the World
The Gods are the world, they alone prevent it from falling apart. Since the Gods are the world, they may intervene as they choose within their realm of expertise to protect those who worship them.

### Worship Practices
Traditionally, each of the deities are worshipped separately in their own temples with massive gatherings to celebrate what the god stands for. Unlike most other pantheons, the Gods are viewed as separate entities and are worshipped separately.

### What Makes a Priest
Priests of the Deus specialize in their knowledge of the teachings of individual Gods, however they are also expected to understand and respect the customs of other priests that worship the other Gods of the pantheon. A priest-to-be must make a pilgramage to a temple of each of the Gods and be trained by an elder there, then return to the temple of their patron deity for special training before they are acknowledged as a priest of their deity.

### The Afterlife
Deus believe that after death, their souls are taken to the underworld by Noxorte, where they spend their time reliving their life from others who experienced contact with the deceased Deus at any point in the Deus' life. This begins with the deceased themselves.


<h2 id="Hexadivinus">Hexadivinus</h2>
**Worshipper Title:** Hexadivinite

**Deities in Pantheon:**

<ul class="nonbulletedlist">
	<li><strong>Aurantiaco</strong>, Lord of the Orange Robe, Elder God of Emotional and Physical Strength -- Associated with the element Earth</li>
	<li><strong>Caesitas</strong>, Lady of the Blue Robe -- Child Goddess of curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge- Associated with the element Water</li>
	<li><strong>Luteus</strong> Lord of the Yellow Robe -- Middle-Aged God of elegant and purposeful order- Associated with the element Light</li>
	<li><strong>Pureum</strong> Lady of the Purple Robe -- Elder Goddess of elegant and purposeful chaos- Associated with the element Darkness</li>
	<li><strong>Rutilun</strong> Lord of the Red Robe -- Child God of emotional passion- Associated with the element Fire</li>
	<li><strong>Viren</strong> Lady of the Green Robe -- Young Goddess of seduction, playfulness, and whimsy- Associated with the element Air</li>
</ul>

### Creation of the World
All six of the the Lords and Ladies gathered together and worked together (for the first time) to create the universe and all therein as an elaborate environment for them to experiment on and play with. It is believed that they will not ever work together again until the end of the world.

### The End of the World
Once the six are done with the universe, they will destroy it as their second collective action.

### The Gods' Role in the World
The six desired a relatively infinite realm of mirrors of themselves (in different parts), and thereby created the universe, that they might live together as a family in practically infinite ways and places, experiencing practically everything. A piece of each god is in everyone, so the only way to grow as an individual is believed to be that you must praise them all. Amongst them, Rutilun cannonically pursues Viren and Caesitas, both goddesses whom he cannot have- wooing them with every power at his disposal, but ultimately failing each and every time. Luteus and Pureum play an incredibly large and extravagant version of chess constantly, and Aurantiaco watches them all, and simply observes the other five's antics, stopping them from ruining the universe, should any of the five do something extreme.

### Worship Practices
Worshippers are expected to find their inner god/goddess, whichever one calls to them the most- and live out their life in praise to that god/goddess primarily, and the other five secondarily. The gender of the god/goddess has nothing to do with the gender of the individual who is called to live out their life (A woman could have her inner God be Rutilun, etc.).

### What Makes a Priest
Priests are often defined as the best representatives of each lord and lady that are within the society- they are expected to act as much like the lord/lady they represent as they possibly can, from acting out legends to acting on only impulses that are thought to be from their specified god.

### The Afterlife
Since each life is actually just one of the lords/ladies' lives, it is expected that they will join their inner diety in the Outside, where all the Gods sit and learn about how they lived- each life telling their story to the others in a never-ending stream of stories and experiences, each as precious as the last.

<h2 id="Kol'lukt">Kol'lukt</h2>
**Worshipper Title:** Challenger

**Deities in Pantheon:**

<ul class="nonbulletedlist">
	<li><strong>Vol'Kris</strong>, the Great Terrador (A giant terrador)</li>
	<li><strong>Dra'kolobrum</strong>, the Great Serpent (A giant dragonsnake)</li>
	<li><strong>Ke'Tu</strong>, the Great Sea Beast (A giant eel)</li>
	<li><strong>Kani'tres</strong>, the Great Three Headed Dog (A giant cerberus)</li>
	<li><strong>Invus</strong>, the Ultimate Challenge (A cerberus with an Eel, Terrador, and Cerberus head and the head of a Dragonsnake on its tail)</li>
</ul>

### Creation of the World
Each individual has their own universe "created" when they are born as their own personal battlefield. Everything therein exists only to test them and make them stronger for the aftermath.

### The End of the World
Each individuals universe ends as soon as they die, since they no longer need it for training. The possibility of the end of the creation and destruction of individuals is largely unexplored- as a kind of a... "who cares" sort of question.

### The Gods' Role in the World
The Gods have not much role in the world, they keep the challengers flowing at them for unknown reasons, but you should probably worship them and learn as much as you can about them if you intend on defeating them. However, the gods do have few priests that wander the world.

### Worship Practices
Becoming a challenge for the Gods is the ultimate form of praise to them. Challengers welcome any form of strengthening themselves or putting themselves to the test, and often duel each other to this end.

### What Makes a Priest
There are no "priests" per-sey of Kol'lukt. The individual is on their own- this world was made for the individual to become stronger. The priests that do exist tend to rely on their own fighting prowess, but can call upon the strength of previous combatants to augment their capabilities. These priests, however, know that when they finally die, they will not be able to rely upon borrowed help, but will have to face the dieties alone. For this reason, priests are incredibly uncommon.

### The Afterlife
Worshippers believe that after death, they are sent forward to face the five Gods individually in a gauntlet, to determine their final resting place. Vol'Kris is the first challenge, followed by Dra'kolobrum, Ke'tu, Kani'tres, and Invus, in that order. If defeated by any of the Gods, the challenger is believed to then serve that god until they deign to give the challenger another chance to run the gauntlet, or indefinitely if the god judges that they are not worthy of trying again. Defeating all of the Gods results in joining the ranks of the True Warriors in the outer world, feasting and fighting and living forever in bliss with the other true warriors.

<h2 id="Magnusanctus">Magnusanctus</h2>
**Worshipper Title:** Follower

**Deities in Pantheon:**
<ul class="nonbulletedlist">
	<li><strong>Magnusancte</strong></li>
</ul>

### Creation of the World
It is believed that Magnusancte created the universe and all in it in an endeavor to find the perfect people to fill his perfect city with, a place that he wished to protect and be loved by for all time, ever growing it larger and larger.

### The End of the World
Once Magnusancte wishes to retire from judging everyone and just to simply live among his subjects, the end of the universe is believed to occur. As long as he keeps judging, the universe will stay forever.

### The Gods' Role in the World
Magnusancte has only one role in the world- to watch over it and keep track of what everyone does and how they do it.

### Worship Practices
Magnusancte is worshipped in a church by a fairly large group of worshippers, lead by their priest. The services are largely teachings of the importance of the seven tenants on which Magnusancte will judge everyone: Purity, Gentleness, Diligence, Altruism, Steadiness, Communion, and Humility.

### What Makes a Priest
Priests of Magnusancte are expected to study the seven different tenants with seven different teachers and dedicate their life to them. After studying under their seven mentors, the new priest is expected to go forth and teach a unique combination of what they learned, teaching others the way of Magnusancte.

### The Afterlife
It is believed that the dead go before Magnusancte after they have died, seeking entry to his perfect city. If they pass his judgement, they will be allowed in. If they do not, they will be cast out and forced to live outside the city's walls with the evil of the world in a land of perpetual harsh conditions, natural disasters, and hordes of dangerous beasts.
