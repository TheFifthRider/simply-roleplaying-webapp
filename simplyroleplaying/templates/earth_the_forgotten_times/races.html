<p>Somewhere in our planet's past there lay many thousands of years that are left unrecorded by time or space. They happened, but were washed away into the aether after some key event which remains undetermined. Listed here are the various races that populated the Earth during those times, but who curiously vanished thereafter, leaving no mark of their existence.</p>

<h3 id="Dwarves">Dwarves</h3>
<p>These short, gray-skinned humanoids spend most of their lives underground, building huge underground cities and basing their economy around whatever they can mine. They are a solitary race that prefers to spend time among itself and have a deep reverence for stone and dirt. Dwarves have perfected the ability that they call "life forging", a combination of smithing and magic that allows a group of dwarves gathered together to, when they perform the correct rites, take the soul of a near-dead dwarf and bind it into an object, creating a magical artifact that the near-dead dwarf can live in. Due to the near holy reverence that Dwarves give to stone, nearly all objects created this way are hewn from a single piece of stone. Depending on the rites performed the object can perform any variety of actions, but is typically limited to telepathically aiding and communicating with the person that is wielding the weapon.</p>

<h3 id="Elves">Elves</h3>
<p>The idea of a beautiful creature so aligned with nature that it might have been there from the beginning almost spells 'Elf' in its description. A race generally classified by their tall, slender appearance, and their uniquely shaped ears, the unique Elven facial structure is frequently quoted as being 'eerily beautiful.' Elves naturally grow to anywhere between 1.68-1.93 meters tall, and are frequently considered underweight for their height. Elves always have a particularly fair complexion, and have the natural array of human hair colors. Their facial structure is particularly angular, and they almost exclusively have almond-shaped eyes and tapered ears.</p>
<p>Their distinctive and aesthetically pleasing appearances belie the natural Elven inclination to be obsessed with beauty. Most Elves are so wrapped up in appearing fair that they will surpress the urge to display emotions at the risk of marring their beauty. Many Elves have become so focused on it that they tend to be prejudiced against individuals who they don't consider to be 'beautiful'. This often leads Elves to be exceptionally selective with breeding and are not inclined to accept Half-Elves (those  Elves sired in part by another race) into their midst due to their percieved impurity. This obsession with beauty also drives many Elves to experiment with modifying the world and its denizens with magic. If the world were to recognize them for what they were, it would be stunned by how frequently Elves were the culprit of it's favorite mythical creatures.</p>
<p>The Elves are known for being reclusive, hiding themselves away in clusters of hidden cities referred to as the 'Elven Lands'. The Elves operate on a meritocracy, a government of officials selected on the basis of their individual ability. As such, it's not uncommon for Elven cities to feature prominently displayed Thieves guilds since they reason that if someone was stolen from, they could not protect the stolen property adequately and therefore didn't deserve to own it in the first place.</p>
<p>Elven culture is firmly rooted in nature. Everything from their city names to their drinks tend to have names pertaining to trees or various plants or trees. Some of the largest Elven cities have a resident pair 'Grovemothers' or 'Grovefathers' who serve as the head of the community and commune with the surrounding trees and nature. The Elven lands are also filled with mysticism, with numerous areas reserved for 'Trials' or 'Rituals'. Religiously, most Elves tend to be Hexadivinites.</p>

<br/>
<h3 id="Faeries">Faerie Races (Fae, Gnomes, Nymphs, Salamanders, and Sylphs)</h3>
<p>Apart from the slight hue change in their skin tone, Faerie races are in nearly every way biologically identical to elves, but still somehow fall short of the beauty of the elves when compared. However, unlike Elves, the Faerie races are heavily aligned with magical elements. Each race has an alternate form that they can switch to, comprised of the element they are aligned to. While in this state, the Faerie is unable to communicate with others outside their specific race (Not just Faerie races, a Salamander cannot talk to any but another Salamander while one or both are in their elemental form) and cannot access any of the items they had previously on them, before they transformed. They are still normally susceptible to nonmagical attacks, but can remove wounds from themselves by absorbing nearby objects and elements of their elemental alignment, such as a campfire for fire, rocks for earth, and ice for water. Additionally, while in their elemental state, the Faeries' innate magic potential is doubled.
<h4>Fae</h4>
<p>Fae are the light aligned, yellow hued Faerie race, and are the most organized of the Faerie races. The Fae settle in large groups around anywhere with lots of reflective materials and in warm climates, as close to the sun as they can get. There are very few Fae cities, but those that do exist are large and ancient, covered in elaborate carvings and beautiful architecture. Fae who wander outside of their cities yearn for the comfort of being within those walls, and often will be searching for a way to take residence in the nearest one. Fae have innate magic with the runes BCHLOVX.</p>
<h4>Gnomes</h4>
<p>Gnomes are the earth aligned, orange hued Faerie race, and are the strongest, most independent of the Faerie races. Gnomes generally do not settle together, but rather go their separate ways to seek their fortune in the world. They rarely journey across the sea, however, because they cannot stand not having solid ground under their feet. When Gnomes do settle together, they create elaborate underground cities that grow in size and complexity as more Gnomes settle in the city. Gnomes have innate magic with the runes BCEHOVX.</p>
<h4>Nymphs</h4>
<p>Nymphs are the water aligned, blue hued Faerie race, and are the most intelligent of the Faerie races. Nymphs form small tribes near bodies of water and prize knowledge more than everything else. The love of knowledge is an incessant call, so Nymph are constantly nomadically traveling from place to place to learn what they can learn. Nymph's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair typically silky white or grey. Nymph tribes often cross each other's paths and trade goods and knowledge from which both tribes benefit, and Nymph caravans will often visit other races in caravans to speak with them. Nymphs have innate magic with the runes BCHOVWX.</p>
<h4>Salamanders</h4>
<p>Salamanders are the fire aligned, red hued Faerie race, and are the most charismatic of the Faerie races. Much like Nymphs, Salamanders nomadically travel in caravans and only settle temporarily in places. Salamanders are arguably the most nomadic Faerie race, simply because they travel for the sole purpose of conversing with other races and having new experiences. Salamander's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair is typically silky black or grey. It is not unheard of for Salamanders to split away from their caravans and find a new life in a city their caravan visits, should they find the place particularly enthralling. Salamanders have innate magic with the runes BCFHOVX.</p>
<h4>Sylphs</h4>
<p>Sylphs are the wind aligned, green hued Faerie race, and are the quickest of the Faerie races. Sylphs are often known to be carefree and whimsical, a product of that sort of behavior being encouraged in their culture. Sylphs believe that physical swiftness or mental acuity are the best possible trait for any to cultivate. Due to this love of adaptability, Sylphs are nomadic like Nymphs and Salamanders. It is not uncommon for Sylph tribes to consist of a single family living in strange and harsh locations. Sylphs have innate magic with the runes ABCHOVX.</p>

<br/>
<h3 id="Gauntians">Gauntians (Solumgaunts, Aerogaunts, and Nexagaunts)</h3>
<p>Gauntian races have an innate magical ability born from closeness to a specific type of animal; the ability to shift into an animal form. Each Gauntian race has its own unique limitations to their transformation that governs what they can become, but generally they can transform at any time over the space of one round (no other actions may be made when transforming). Transforming is dangerous, too. Gauntian races that stay in their animal form for too long are stuck in that form and cannot get out of it. Trapped Gauntians will slowly lose their sentience until they relapse into the mindset of a wild animal. When in their animal form Gauntian races cannot cast magic.</p>
<h4>Aerogaunts</h4>
<p>Aerogaunts are a tribal society who can transform into birds. An aerogaunt can only become one kind of bird, and will display physical characteristics relating to that bird. Common physical characteristics are patches of feathers on their body around their neck and head, often blending with the hair on their head. Anomalies that can transform into multiple birds do exist, though they are rare. Talk to your GM if you want your character to be one of these anomalies. Aerogaunts typically gather together and form tribes, much like their bird forms would flock together. Most Aerogaunts can transform into a regularly sized bird, and cannot stay in their animal form for more than 24 hours or be trapped. These Aerogaunts retain their normal stats while transformed, but cannot transform into anything larger than 1.5m tall. There are, however, Aerogaunts that can transform into larger birds and larger forms of birds. These Aerogaunts are known as Dires, and transform into birds roughly 4m tall, regardless of the size of the original bird and gain +1d4 to agility and brawn. However, Dires also suffer a penalty of -1d4 to intuition and knowledge while transformed and cannot stay in their dire form for longer than an hour, else they become trapped.</p>
<h4>Solumgaunts</h4>
<p>Solumgaunts are essentially the same thing as Aerogaunts, but with a few differences; they too are a tribal society who can transform, but they can transform into land animals. Like Aerogaunts, Solumgaunts can only become one kind of animal and display features relating to that animal; usually patches of fur or scales along their neck, a tail, and the ears of the animal that they transform into. Anomalies that can become more than one kind of animal do exist, albiet as a rarity. Talk to your GM if you want your character to be one of these anomalies. Solumgaunts typically gather and form tribes much like their animal forms would. Most Solumgaunts can transform into a regularly sized land creature, and cannot stay in their animal form for more than 24 hours or else they'd be trapped. These Solumgaunts retain their normal stats while transformed, but cannot transform into anything larger than a lion. There are, however, Solumgaunts who can transform into larger animals and larger forms of animals. These Solumgaunts are known as Dires, and can transform into animals roughly 4m long, regardless of the size of the original animal and gain +1d4 to agility and brawn. However, Dires also suffer a penalty of -1d4 to intuition and knowledge while transformed and cannot stay in their dire form for longer than an hour, else they become trapped.</p>
<h4>Nexagaunts</h4>
<p>Nexagaunts are generally not accepted in Solumgaunt and Aerogaunt society because they have developed the ability to transform into a hybrid between their animal and human state, rather than a full animal state. These hybrid states are roughly the same size as the Nexagaunt when in their non-animal form. While in this state, the Nexagaunt experiences a bonus of +2 to agility and brawn rolls, but also a penalty of -1d4 in charisma, and -2 in intuition and knowledge. Nexagaunts can cast magic and speak while transformed, unlike Solumgaunts and Aerogaunts.</p>
<a href="#">Back to Top</a>
<br/>
<h3 id="Giants">Giant Races (Sasquatch, Ogres, and Trolls)</h3>
<p>These enormous races hail from the north where their stature is required to keep warm. However, their size comes with a more pressing concern- none of them can speak but a few words to any race outside their own. As such, their charisma stat is stuck at 1d4, and the character may only have 16 points to spend at character creation, of which no more than the one required point may be spent in charisma.</p>
<h4>Sasquatch</h4>
<p>The 3 meter tall Sasquatch are fairly easy to distinguish from other forms of Giants because of the thick layer of brown, white, or black fur that covers their body. Most Sasquatch view clothing as "unnecessary fur", so seeing a Sasquatch with even rudimentary clothing is a rarity. Sasquatch tend to dwell in hutted tribes or in caves, often traveling in groups of less than a dozen. Most Sasquatch are considered to be fairly unintelligent and uncivilized, despite the fact that many are just as intelligent as any other race. Due to their loner ways, however, Sasquatch have adapted to physical prowess and have a racial +1d4 bonus in brawn and +3 to their maximum wound total.
<h4>Ogres</h4>
<p>If bad feelings are felt towards Sasquatch, far worse feelings are felt towards their slightly taller (usually around 3.5 meter tall) cousins, Ogres. Ogres are generally considered to be more human due to the fact that they are not covered with fur and are typically wearing clothing, but considered far less human due to their tendency to be cannibalistic. Ogres believe that in order to grow stronger, one must devour the flesh of their opponent directly after defeating the opponent. Because of this, Ogres are seen as barbaric and feral, when in reality Ogres are no less intelligent than any other race. Ogres are the strongest of all races, with a 1d6 racial bonus to brawn and +1 to their maximum wound total.</p>
<h4>Trolls</h4>
<p>Trolls are huge. That's pretty much the first reaction everyone has when encountering them. Unlike Ogres and Sasquatch, Trolls actually look the least human, with an appearance like a Giant hairless-sloth. They stand an impressive 4.5 meters tall, but are quite slow. Most of their size is not muscle tissue, but actually fat to keep them warm in the harsh, cold tundras that they come from. Because of their stature and speed, Trolls have a +1d4 bonus to brawn, a -1d4 detriment to agility, and +6 to their maximum wound total.</p>

<br/>
<h3 id="Humans">Humans</h3>
<p>Generally tanned and just under two meters tall, humans are just what you'd expect. While it is true that humans remained around after the mysterious calamity that wiped out the remainder of these races, they underwent radical changes and have completely forgotten the details of these times. The cause of this shift is still unknown, but is theorized to have been some form of ubermagic.</p>
<a href="#">Back to Top</a>
<br/>
<h3 id="Marine">Marine Races (Mer and Deep Ones)</h3>
<p>Being the only two major marine races, Deep Ones and Mer have developed a depth of hatred of one another rivaled only by the depth of their mutual home. Because Mer are more commonly found visiting the surface than the Deep Ones, the general consensus is that they are viewed in a more positive light than the Deep Ones.
<h4>Mer</h4>
<p>Mer are generally considered the intelligent and reasonable dwellers of the deep by the surface world. Whether this is true or not, Mer are almost exactly like humans, with a few aquatic additions. Namely, Mer have gills positioned behind their ears and under their jaw. Additionally, Mer have a thin and extremely durable sheath of scales that can be used to bind their legs together into a seamless tail for quick swimming underwater, not unlike that of a fish. With the sheath equipped, Mer have +2 to all agility checks while underwater, but -2 to all agility checks on land.</p>
<h4>Deep Ones</h4>
<p>Deep Ones are ancient beings of the water that some consider to be slightly devolved versions of humans. Their bones are very thinly coated in muscle, and chunks of seaweed and coral is often stuck to their limp, slick green skin. They are amphibious, and have much love of water and the creatures that reside therein. Unfortunately, Deep Ones have difficulty communicating with other races, as they never developed a mouth. As a result, they communicate telepathically and have an innate affinity with magic. Because of this and their deformed appearance, very few Deep Ones are found among other races, though many sailors fearfully whisper tales of them. They have both lungs and gills, and can use either at will. Regardless of this fact, they must remain hydrated in the same way that vampires must feast on blood, so they tend to prefer the comforting wetness of the briny deep.</p>
<p>Every 24 hours a Deep One goes without submerging their body completely in water reduces their maximum wound level by one. This can reduce their maximum wound level to a negative value, putting them into a coma and killing them if they ever drop below their lowest possible wound level.</p>
<a href="#">Back to Top</a>
<br/>
<h3 id="Orcish">Orcish Races (Goblins, Orcs, and Night Orcs)</h3>
<h4>Goblins</h4>
<p>The most common race of the Orcish Races, Goblins look like spindly, diminutive Orcs (around 1.5 meters tall) with large, hooked noses. Goblins are tribal and notoriously spontaneous. Thus, their culture will often create sprawling camps that have multiple layers of walls, simply because they created the first camp and subsequently discovered that they neeeded more room. They do not build things to last and are known to periodically move to a new home because they were bored of their previous one.</p>
<h4>Orcs</h4>
<p>Pale skin with an ever so slightly green tint to it, wild black hair, and heavily muscled bodies are some of the first impressions that most have when encountering Orcs. As tenacious as they are intimidating, Orcs tend to be courageous and can endure even the most painful of hardships, sometimes even as well as fiends. Fiercely proud and loyal, some races consider them to be barbaric or backwards, but in truth they simply have no patience for underhandedness. Orcs are among the most honest people that anyone may encounter, something which comes as both a blessing and a curse, as they can easily enrage other races whose diplomatic relations requires more... tact. They form tribes of reasonable sizes and prefer to create their camps out of proof of their strength, such as hide huts from hunting and such. There <em>are</em> many Orc cities made out of stone, but most Orcs settle in tribal encampments.
<h4>Night Orcs</h4>
<p>Everything that is bad about Orcs is exponentially worse with Night Orcs. Night Orcs are one of the only races who actively seek to destroy the other races, and whose only preservation has been sheer numbers. With purplish-grey skin and the ability to mature from child to adult in a matter of months, it doesn't even matter that the maximum lifespan of a Night Orc is 20 years. Night Orcs are ferocious, dangerous, vindictive, and downright cruel. Few races can reason with them, let alone get along with them. Still, they are intelligent beings and can communicate very effectively. It is theorized that their battle lust stems from Heagar, the destroyer dragon who sleeps wrapped around the world underground, but the connection has not been proven.</p>
<a href="#">Back to Top</a>
<br/>
<h3 id="Outcasts">Outcast Races (Fiends and Succubi)</h3>
<p>Names that they themselves did not choose with but were rather dubbed by other races, Fiends and Succubi are widely distrusted by most other races due to the fact that their bodies are heavily modified by magic.</p>
<h4>Fiends</h4>
<p>Fiends are a proud, towering, obsidian-skinned race with antler-like horns sprouting from their brow. In their own language, there is no word for a distinction between the different races, merely a difference in strength. In their own tongue, they are "strong ones" -- an appropriate name when one considers their naturally developing muscles and 2.5 meter average height. A fierce, proud race, the Fiends are the founders of the Kol'lukt religion, and most Fiends are practitioners of that religion.</p>
<p>Fiends are considerably stronger than most other races, granting them a racial bonus of +2  maximum wounds and +1d6 to all Brawn rolls. However, they have only 15 points to spend in character creation.</p>
<h4>Succubi</h4>
<p>Succubi were the exact same race as Fiends at one time, but disliked their heavily muscled form-- preferring instead the beauty of the other races. Their desire to mimic the other races prompted magical interference with their own genetic makeup, eventually allowing them to shift their physical features at will into seamless replicas of others (This does not change the Succubus' stats). However, with so much magical power in their body, Succubi became weaker in almost every other respect, and are faced with a nearly vampirism-like desire for experiencing and observing acts of a sexual nature. They can inspire the desire for such acts in others and absorb the energy generated by such acts within 10 meters of them, subtly tiring the individuals performing the act as if they were performing an immensely difficult task. This typically causing the individuals to pass out with elated exhaustion after their sexual climax. Similar to vampires, each day that a succubus goes without this nourishment lowers the Succubus' maximum stamina by one, which can only be replenished by feeding. Reduction to zero or less stamina causes the Succubus to fall into a coma that can be fatal if they are not infused with magical energies to stabilize them within 48 hours of falling into a coma.</p>
<p>Succubi are sexless, can change their gender and racial appearance at will, and also have a natural +1d8 racial bonus to charisma checks. However, this power comes at a steep price as they only have 12 points to spend at character creation. Within 24 hours that a succubus has fed they get an additional racial +2 bonus to all skill checks. Children sired by a Succubus are invariably Succubi, and can only be birthed by other races.</p>
<a href="#">Back to Top</a>
<br/>
<h3 id="Revenants">Revenants</h3>
<p>Revenants are the only race that are not organically produced. The common man would refer to Revenants as being "undead", but such a term is a broad miscategorization of what revenants truly are. Revenants are magic users of any race who have had their lifespan extended by the binding of their soul to organic material through magical bonds, somewhat similar to the Dwarven method of "life forging". When a creature is born, their soul is tethered to their body by a cord of energy; when they die, that cord breaks. Revenants are created by gluing the cord back on with magic, albiet crudely. The most pressing concern with being a Revenant is that their skin and bones cease growing and only deteriorate, requiring them to constantly graft new parts onto themselves. While newly created Revenants look pretty much exactly how they did when they died, older ones have been known to look more than a little bit creepy, with parts grafted where they do not naturally appear. Because they are created with a magical tether, revenants can be killed with a forcible enough disenchantment. To signify this, Revenants cannot recover wounds, but can graft parts from fallen enemies to remove wounds.</p>
<a href="#">Back to Top</a>
<br/>
<h3 id="Vampires">Vampire Races (Cave, High, and Hellpires)</h3>
<p>Vampires are a broad class of races that are most commonly associated with bats. It is unknown from whence their origin comes, but it is speculated that High Vampires spread the disease among some kind of bat-like animal race that, over the generations, became more human, resulting in the birth of the first Hellpire. The theory further states that Cave Vampires came from the crossbreeding of the Hellpires and other humanoid races.</p>
<p>Vampires can bite their victim with the damage properties of a regular unarmed blow if they have successfully grappled their opponent (Agility roll), but pay for this unique ability with necessity. Every day a Vampire goes without biting and draining life essence from a non-Vampire, non-Revenant being reduces their maximum stamina by one. If their maximum stamina ever reaches zero or below, they are plunged into a coma. If, after 48 hours, they are not infused by rejuvenating magical energy, they will die. Because of this urge, most other races view them with discomfort as they are never sure if the ampires are viewing them as peers or food.</p>
<h4>Cave Vampires</h4>
<p>Cave Vampires live in the crypts of large, usually abandoned structures. They fiercely defend their homes and seek harm on almost all other races. Cave Vampires are most commonly recognized by their sunken eyes, bat-like wings that sprout out of their backs, and their deceptively spindly and bony build. Ages of distrust and discrimination between the Cave Vampires and most other races has led to high tensions. Because of this and their freakish appearance, Cave Vampires typically do not enter  settlements of other races unless they have gone particularly wild, and wish to attack another race.</p>
<p>Cave Vampires that bite their victim inflict wounds and stamina equal to a single unarmed strike, draining their victim and recovering wounds and stamina equal to half the amount of damage they deal, rounded down.</p>
<h4>Hellpires</h4>
<p>Hellpires are possibly the most feared form of Vampire. Living almost exclusively in caves, Hellpires are much like High Vampires in that they usually appear as a regular humanoid. However, this is not because of a mastery of changing themselves, but rather an innate ability to project a humanoid shape and sized illusion of themselves. When their illusion has been dispelled (whether by themselves or by a magic user of a high enough skill), they appear as gigantic humanoid bats approximately 3 meters tall.</p>
<p>When a Hellpire bites someone they can attempt a mind attack on their victim to break them, turning them into a mindless husk that serves the Hellpire. Mindless husks require the constant focus of their creator to control, so it is uncommon to see more than one following around a Hellpire. In addition, it is highly unlikely to see a husk staying around a Hellpire for more than a few hours, as the husk is able to constantly resist the Hellpire's influence every two rounds. A husk that has been freed from a Hellpire's control is disoriented, but will return to themselves after 2 rounds.</p>
<h4>High Vampires</h4>
<p>High Vampires are the most audacious of all the various races of Vampires in terms of fraternization with the other races. Blending in seamlessly with their surroundings, High Vampires can only spread themselves by biting their victim, unlike Hellpires and Cave Vampires, due to the fact that High Vampires are the product of a disease which sterlizes them and shifts their race into that of a High Vampire. High Vampires are more of a mutation than a race, High Vampires look exactly like the race that they once were. Other vampires and Revenants are immune to High Vampirism, but any other race that is infected by high vampirism loses their previous race's abilities, such as a Solumngaunts ability to transform. High Vampires can change their facial and bodily features at will with innate magic, but cannot change their particularly long canines that develop upon being bitten.</p>
<p>When a High Vampire bites someone, they have a chance to put their victim into a trance-like state in which the High Vampire can manipulate the memories of the victim. If this is successful, the high vampire can drain a person dry with no resistance. Because High Vampirism is a disease, the biter always has a 10% chance of passing it on whenever they bite a victim.</p>
