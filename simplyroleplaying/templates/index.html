  A role playing game is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Each player takes responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.
  There are several forms of RPG, but Simply Roleplaying is of the original form, sometimes called the tabletop RPG. It is conducted via discussion, talking out actions and decisions.

  <h2>Some basics</h2>
  <p>Before you dive straight into Simply Roleplaying, there are a few common mechanics in the system to understand.</p>
  <h3>Die Levels</h3>
  <p>In Simply Roleplaying, the four sided die, six sided die, eight sided die, ten sided die, and twelve sided die are the most commonly used dice, and are typically used as a representation of different levels of ability. For this reason, Simply Roleplaying uses a concept referred to as Die Levels. <strong>Die levels</strong> range from 1 to 5, where Die Level 1 represents a four sided die (1d4), die level 2 represents six sided die (1d6), die level 3 represents an eight sided die (1d8), and so on.</p>
