Simply Roleplaying is a role playing game system that is designed to be easily accessible to any level of player. This site was created specifically to be a reference guide for any players -- the GameMaster's (GM's) manual for this system is still a work in progress.

A role playing game is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Each player takes responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.
There are several forms of RPG, but Simply Roleplaying is of the original form, sometimes called the tabletop RPG. It is conducted via discussion, talking out actions and decisions.

Within these pages, you will see exactly what the Simply Roleplaying system has to offer to you as a role player. This website is specifically engineered towards being a player's handbook of sorts, acting as a reference for you.

## Some basics
Before you dive straight into Simply Roleplaying, there are a few common mechanics in the system to understand.

### Die Levels
In Simply Roleplaying, the four sided die, six sided die, eight sided die, ten sided die, and twelve sided die are the most commonly used dice, and are typically used as a representation of different levels of ability. For this reason, Simply Roleplaying uses a concept referred to as Die Levels. **Die levels** range from 1 to 5, where level 1 represents a four sided die (1d4), level 2 represents six sided die (1d6), level 3 represents an eight sided die (1d8), and so on. The table below can be used as a reference to determine the die used based on the appropriate die level.

{{ renderDefaultTable("Dice Levels",
   [
   ["Die Level", "Die Used"],
   ["Level 1", "1d4 (four-sided die)"],
   ["Level 2", "1d6 (six-sided die)"],
   ["Level 3", "1d8 (eight-sided die)"],
   ["Level 4", "1d10 (ten-sided die)"],
   ["Level 5", "1d12 (twelve-sided die)"],
   ],

 }}
