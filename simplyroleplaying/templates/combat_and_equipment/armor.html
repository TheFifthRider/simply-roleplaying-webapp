Defensive clothing of any kind, from personal shield generators to kevlar to platemail, are considered to be armor in the Simply Roleplaying system. In Simply Roleplaying, each piece of armor that a character is wearing provides them with Armor Value, which is totalled to determine the wearers total Armor Value. This Armor Value (AV) is the number rolled against whenever a character rolls a potency check to see how many wounds they inflict upon their target. More information on exactly how Armor Value works in combat is available on [the main combat page.]({{url_for('combat')}}). Much like weapons, armor are categorized by two factors. The two factors are their location (Chest, Arms, Legs, Feet, Shield, or Full Body) and their weight (Improvised, Light, Moderate, or Heavy).

Armor worn on a character's chest, arms, legs, or feet are simply defensive clothing that are worn on those body parts. Each character may only recieve the benefits of one piece of armor worn in that location, so if an archer has a leather chestplate with 5 AV worn over a shirt made out of mithril that has 8 AV, they would add 8 to their total armor value, not 13. Shields are carried by a character on their arm, so they fall under the same rules as for weapons. Namely, a character can only be actively using two hands worth of items during each of their turns in combat. Characters with more than two arms may carry multiple things, but must declare which two hands worth of items they are wielding at the beginning of combat, and can only change which items they are wielding at the beginning of each of their turns. If one of the items that a character is wielding is a shield, they may add the shield's AV to their total AV for as long as they are wielding it. Full body armor is uncommon and typically refers to things like personal shield generators and natural armor, like scales. Full body armor works like exceptionally restrictive locational armor- if a character adds the armor value provided by a piece of full body armor to their total armor value, they cannot count any other piece of armor towards it. This includes shields.

As a general rule, the heavier a piece of armor is, the better it protects the wearer. Armor comes in four weight classes; Improvised, Light, Moderate, and Heavy. An improvised piece of armor is just what it sounds like- any piece of armor that is thrown together or not necessarily intended to be armor would fall into this category. Examples of improvised pieces of armor would be lashing tree bark to oneself or using a briefcase as a shield. Pieces of light armor one can have a reasonable amount of dexterity in and, with practice, that shouldn't restrict the wearer's movement in any major way. Some examples of pieces of light pieces of armor are studded leather gauntlets or a kevlar vest. Pieces of armor are considered to be medium if the piece of armor restricts movement somewhat and generally weighs enough that it is laborious to move quickly in. Some examples of medium pieces of armor are chainmail or a ballistic vest. Heavy pieces of armor are notable in that they are typically the most movement-restricting but the most protective pieces of armor. Some examples of heavy pieces of armor are a suit of iron platemail or a pair of lead-lined boots.

The table below lists the average armor value of each piece of armor, based on weight and location.

As mentioned earlier, the weight of armor can restrict the movement of the individual wearing or wielding it. In Simply Roleplaying, this is represented in three ways. The first is that heavier armor will make some skill checks harder for any character who is wearing them. It's hard to swim with platemail on just like it's difficult to balance on a felled tree in a hazmat suit. This is largely up to your GM's discretion, however, so talk to them about how your armor might affect you. The second is that heavier pieces of armor are more difficult to put on. It is extremely unlikely (and sometimes impossible!) for a character to sleep with armor on. Given that, your character is likely to take their armor off at some point. Lighter armor is quicker to put on in the case of a midnight emergency, but heavier armor takes time. Improvised and Moderate pieces of armor can be put on one at a time for **one minor action per piece**. Light armor can be put on even quicker, at a speed of **one minor action per two pieces**. Heavy armor takes the longest to put on, as it requires **one major action per piece** to equip. The last way that armor weight affects a character is in how armor changes the amount of distance a character can travel in a minor action. Without any armor on, a character can travel up to 15 meters with the use of a minor action. However, depending on how much armor they have on, they might be restricted down to 10 meters. For every two improvised or moderate pieces of armor a character is wearing or wielding (rounded up), they move 1 less meter per minor action. Heavy armor slows an individual down even more. For **each** heavy piece of armor a character is wearing or wielding, they move 1 less meter per minor action. If a character is wearing a piece of armor that counts as full body armor, it counts as 5 pieces of armor for this purpose.
