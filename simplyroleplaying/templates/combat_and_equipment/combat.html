<p>In the Simply Roleplaying system, combat is designed to be fairly simple while also allowing for a variety of different weapons and combat styles, as well as offering a variety of different techniques that can be performed in combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls a flat <a href="{{url_for('stats')}}#Intuition">Intuition</a> check unmodified by bonuses provided by any skill. This check determines how quickly each of the characters reacts to the combat scenario. In the event of an ambush, the ambushers may roll their Intuition twice, and use the combined value. The participants are then ordered by the amount they rolled, and that becomes the turn order. The combat begins with the first character in the turn order and proceeds through the turn order until it reaches the end. This full rotation is considered a combat "round". Each round takes approximately 10 seconds, with all actions happening in the round occurring roughly simultaneously.</p>
<p>Each turn, a character may perform up to two actions, one major and one minor, in no particular order. A minor action is either an action that requires no substantial effort and can be accomplished swiftly, or is something that does not strictly take up all of the character's focus. Some examples of minor actions are a character attempting to jump a gap, climb a ladder, hide behind a pillar, draw a weapon, or trigger a simple mechanism. Major actions are for more technical actions that a character might want to take. Typically, a major action is something like attacking with a weapon or casting a spell, but it can also be repairing some broken machinery, attempting to decipher cryptic and faded runes, or attempting to unlock a lock. Any minor action that a character can perform can be performed in place of the character's major action for the turn.</p>
<p>In the real world, you aren't just as good at swinging an axe as you are stabbing with a spear, and Simply Roleplaying seeks to mimic that. To this end, the Accuracy skill and the Potency skill both are actually split into many different skills, each to represent a different weapon size and style. Each Accuracy or Potency skill is followed by a [Size] and [Style] classifier. For example: Accuracy with Small Slashing would be applicable for a knife wielding character, and Potency with Large Repeating would be applicable for a full-auto machine gun wielding character. More on this is discussed on the <a href="{{url_for('weapons')}}">weapons page</a>.</p>
<p>In a similar way it's difficult to have a single evasion skill, so evading an attack is split up into two different categories depending on whether the attack is considered Direct or Indirect. An attack is considered Direct if the defender is explicitly targetted by the attack, and if the attack could be completely evaded by quick movement. In the case of a Direct attack, the defender will roll a Dodge check, which is an Agility based skill. An attack is considered Indirect if the defender is not the explicit target, but is somehow affected by the attack- usually in the case of area-of-effect attacks that will affect multiple people, or if the attack could not be completely evaded by quick movement. In the case of an Indirect attack, the defender will roll a Reflexes check, which is an Intuition based skill.</p>
<p>One last thing to that is mentioned on this page is Armor Value. Armor value (AV) is what the attacker rolls their Potency check against when determining damage. Every piece of armor that a character is wearing contributes to their total armor valu. Depending on how well the attacker rolls, the defender is dealt damage for a weak, medium, or strong hit, respectively. More on armor value can be found on the <a href="{{url_for('armor')}}">armor page</a>.</p>


<h2>Combat Flow</h2>
<p>Now that that is all cleared up, we can discuss the flow of combat. This consists of determining whether or not the attacker hit the defender, then how well the attacker hit the defender. The steps of combat are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Attacker rolls their Accuracy against the defender's appropriate evasion check (Dodge against a direct attack like a sword or a rifle, Reflexes against an indirect attack like stones falling or an explosion) to see whether or not the attacker hits</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If the attacker's roll is higher than half of the defender's roll, the attack hits.</li>
		<li>If the attacker's roll is equivalent or greater to the defender's roll and the attacker's maximum number of attacks has not been exceeded, the defender is outmaneuvered and the attacker can perform another attack. An attacker's maximum number of attacks is determined by the size of the largest weapon the attacker is wielding. If the attacker's largest weapon is a small weapon, they may attack (at most) three times in a combat round. If the attacker's largest weapon is a medium weapon, they may attack (at most) two times in a combat round. Otherwise, they may only attack once per combat round.</li>
		<li>If the attacker's roll is equal to or less than half of the defender's roll, the attacker is outmaneuvered and the defender can make an attack or perform a combat maneuver.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>If the attacker hits the defender, the attacker then rolls for their weapon's Potency, which determines the total amount of damage dealt by the attacker.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If the attacker's Potency check results in a value greater than the defender's Armor Value, the attacker hits for a strong hit.</li>
		<li>If the attacker's Potency check results in a value lower than the defender's Armor Value, but greater than half of the defender's Armor Value, the attacker hits for a medium hit.</li>
		<li>If the attacker's Potency check results in a value lower than half of the defender's Armor Value, the attacker hits for a weak hit.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
