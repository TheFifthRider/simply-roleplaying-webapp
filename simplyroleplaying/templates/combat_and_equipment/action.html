When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, the timing of when each character can do what is critically important. These kinds of scenarios are referred to as **Action scenarios**. We define the most common types of action scenarios before, though your GM may choose to make their own.

### Rounds
Almost every action scenario is turn based, to allow all players an opportunity to take the spotlight. When each participant has taken a **turn** in the **turn order**, that signifies the completion of a **round** of the action scenario. A good example of how this works is to imagine any action packed scene in a movie-- each character is going to get their time in the camera where they are the focus of the shot, even though everything that is happening on the screen is happening at the same time. The end of each round marks the progression in time. Typically, each round of an action scenario lasts around ten seconds, but this can vary based on what makes sense for the action scenario.

#### Rolling for Initiative
There are several ways of determining the character order in rounds, the most popular in roleplaying games is **rolling for initiative**. To roll for initiative in Simply Roleplaying, at the beginning of the action scenario, each participant makes an Intuition roll. Each combatant marks the result of this value as their **initiative** for the scenario. Then, each character takes their turn in order from highest roll to lowest roll. Ties can be broken by the die level of the Intuition stat. A common way of representing this is to add the die level of the stat as a decimal at the end of their roll.

 #### Elective Action Intiatve
 The following is a slight twist on a ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post [Accidentally Designing Marvelâ€™s Action Order System](http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2012/02/marvel/).

## Freeform Scenario
The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when strict rules for an action scenario simply do not serve it well. A **freeform scenario** is any scenario that uses some, but not all, rules from other action scenarios to allow each character the freedom to act how they choose as it makes sense to the scenario. Your GM will ultimately decide what makes sense, so be sure to stick by whatever guidelines they give you.

In the Simply Roleplaying system, combat is designed to be fairly simple while also allowing for a variety of different weapons and combat styles, as well as offering a variety of different techniques that can be performed in combat. Each round takes approximately 10 seconds of game time, with all actions happening in the round occurring roughly sequentially. -->
