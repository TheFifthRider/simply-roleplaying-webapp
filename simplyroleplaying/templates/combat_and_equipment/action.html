When the dragon stirs or the guards raise the alarm, the timing of when each character can do what is critically important. These kinds of scenarios are referred to as **Action scenarios**. We define the most common types of action scenarios before, though your GM may choose to make their own.

### Rounds
An action scenario occurs in blocks of time referred to as **rounds**. A round often takes around ten seconds, but your GM may vary this based on what makes sense for the action scenario. Most of the time, each character involved in the action takes their time in the spotlight by taking a **turn** in a specific order. If a character acts outside of when they would usually act in the turn order, they are considered to be **interrupting** the turn order.

#### Rolling for Initiative
There are several ways of determining the character order in rounds, the most popular in roleplaying games is **rolling for initiative**. To roll for initiative in Simply Roleplaying, at the beginning of the action scenario, each participant makes an Intuition roll. Each participant marks the result of this value as their **initiative** for the scenario. Then, each character takes their turn in order from highest roll to lowest roll. Ties can be broken by the die level of the Intuition stat. A common way of representing this is to add the die level of the stat as a decimal at the end of their roll. Further ties can be broken at GM discretion. Characters who join the action after the initial rolls simply roll for initiative at the start of the round in which they join the action.

##### Alternative Rule: Elective Action Order
The following is adapted from the ruleset designed by Fred Hicks on his blog post [Accidentally Designing Marvelâ€™s Action Order System](http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2012/02/marvel/).

After rolling for initiative, instead of ordering participants from highest roll to lowest roll, the highest roller is simply the first to act. In the case of an ambush, tensions broken by the first shot fired, or some other situation where it is clear who will (or has) acted first your GM may opt to skip rolling and instead start the turn order with that character. After each character finishes their turn, they chose a character who has not taken a turn yet this round to take their turn next. The last character to take a turn in the round chooses who starts the next round.

If another character interrupts the turn order the chosen character does not take their turn. Instead, the interrupting character may take their turn (if they have not already done so in this round) or choose the next character to act. Characters who join the action join at the start of each round and are then chosen when they can act by the other characters in the action as usual.

## Freeform Scenario
The tide of lava rises, the rope bridges' tenuous connections begin to sever, the toxic gas flows under the door and across the room-- there are many times when strict rules for an action scenario simply do not serve it well. A **freeform scenario** is any scenario that uses some, but not all, rules from other action scenarios to allow each character the freedom to act how they choose as it makes sense to the scenario. Your GM will ultimately decide what makes sense, so be sure to stick by whatever guidelines they give you.

<!-- TODO: Finish

In the Simply Roleplaying system, combat is designed to be fairly simple while also allowing for a variety of different weapons and combat styles, as well as offering a variety of different techniques that can be performed in combat. Each round takes approximately 10 seconds of game time, with all actions happening in the round occurring roughly sequentially. -->
