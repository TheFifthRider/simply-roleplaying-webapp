<p>Weapons in Simply Roleplaying come in many different varieties, and are specifically categorized by their size and the style of the weapon. Any weapon should be able to be categorized in this way.</p>
<p>In terms of size, small weapons should be able to be wielded with one hand and nearly impossible to be wielded with two. Daggers, miniature crossbows, pistols, and brass knuckles are typically considered to be small weapons. Large weapons, on the other hand, typically require two hands to hold them. Rocket launchers, mauls, longbows, and staves are typically considered to be large weapons. Medium weapons are the weapons that end up between those two categories. Longswords, many rifles, police batons, and crossbows are typically considered to be medium weapons.</p>

<h2>Melee Weapons</h2>
<p>Melee weapons have six possible styles; Improvised, Battering, Hooking, Slashing, Impaling, and Cleaving. Battering weapons are typically blunt instruments, such as staves, batons, and maces. Hooking weapons are curved blades that necessitates the wielder making hooking motions when they attack, such as sickles, scythes, and some curved blades. Slashing weapons are any types of weapons used in a slashing manner, such as katanas, hunting knives, or longswords. Impaling weapons are weapons that are used with stabbing motions, like rapiers, bayonets, and spears. Cleaving weapons are typically heavy, bladed instruments that are swung with a chop, like axes and cleavers. Improvised weapons are objects that are not intended to be used as weapons, but that have been weaponized- like a table leg or a farming implement. See table C1 below for melee weapon damage by style and size.</p>

<h2>Ranged Weapons</h2>
<p>Ranged weapons function similarly to melee weapons, but have different styles. The five ranged weapon styles are Improvised, Payload, Precision, Repeating, and Spread. A Payload ranged weapon is something that delivers a heavy or explosive charge, like a grenade launcher or a cannon. A Precision ranged weapon is something that fires typically one round with a lot of power behind the shot, like a crossbow or a semi-automatic rifle. A Repeating ranged weapon is something that fires in clusters, like spears from a Hwacha or a burst from an automatic rifle. A Spread ranged weapon is something that typically fires some kind of shrapnel instead of an individual shot, like a shotgun or a sling filled with gravel. See table C2 for ranged weapon damage by style and size.</p>
<p>Ranged weapons have a "run and gun" range of 15m, across the board but this can be increased substantially if the attacker takes some time to set up first. What this means is that ranged weapons have an effective range of 15m, but if they use a major action, a ranged weapon wielding character can "set up" their weapon, which enables it to be used at a longer range. Most ranged weapons have a "set up range" value and a "maximum range" value. When set up, the ranged weapon can be fired at any target past 15m up to their set up range at no penalty. Targets that are beyond the set up range, but within the maximum range, or targets that are within 15m of the attacker can be fired upon, but the attacker must roll accuracy twice and take the lower value. While set up like this, the ranged weapon wielder can only move at half of their normal speed. Rules for speed are detailed on the <a href="{{url_for('armor')}}">armor page</a>. As a minor action, a ranged weapon wielder can choose to stop being set up and return to their normal range and speed.</p>

<h2>Elemental Weapons</h2>
<p>Sometimes a weapon will behave in a way that utilizes a raw application of matter. This is usally the case when wielding some kind of weapon that utilizes raw chemical reactions, such as a homemade flamethrower or a piece of ancient alien technology. Often these weapons will deal damage in an area of effect, rather than a single target. Because they are typically area of effect weapons, these type of weapons are always considered to be large in size. However, they will have distinct levels of power associated with the damage they deal. The five styles of elemental weapons are Force, Gaseous, Liquid, Solid, and Plasma. Each style is fairly self explanatory, indicating the element which is manipulated by the weapon. See table C3 below for elemental weapon damage by style and power level.</p>
