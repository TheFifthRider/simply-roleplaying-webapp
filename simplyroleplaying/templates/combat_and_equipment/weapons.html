<p>Weapons in Simply Roleplaying come in many different varieties, and are specifically categorized by their size and the style of the weapon. Any weapon should be able to be categorized in this way.</p>
<p>In terms of size, small weapons should be able to be wielded with one hand and nearly impossible to be wielded with two. Daggers, miniature crossbows, pistols, and brass knuckles are typically considered to be small weapons. Large weapons, on the other hand, typically require two hands to hold them. Rocket launchers, mauls, longbows, and staves are typically considered to be large weapons. Medium weapons are the weapons that end up between those two categories. Longswords, many rifles, police batons, and crossbows are typically considered to be medium weapons.</p>

<h2>Melee Weapons</h2>
<p>Melee weapons have six possible styles; Improvised, Battering, Hooking, Slashing, Impaling, and Cleaving. Battering weapons are typically blunt instruments, such as staves, batons, and maces. Hooking weapons are curved blades that necessitates the wielder making hooking motions when they attack, such as sickles, scythes, and some curved blades. Slashing weapons are any types of weapons used in a slashing manner, such as katanas, hunting knives, or longswords. Impaling weapons are weapons that are used with stabbing motions, like rapiers, bayonets, and spears. Cleaving weapons are typically heavy, bladed instruments that are swung with a chop, like axes and cleavers. Improvised weapons are objects that are not intended to be used as weapons, but that have been weaponized- like a table leg or a farming implement. See table C1 below for melee weapon damage by style and size.</p>

<h2>Ranged Weapons</h2>
<p>Ranged weapons function similarly to melee weapons, but have different styles. The five ranged weapon styles are Improvised, Payload, Precision, Repeating, and Spread. A Payload ranged weapon is something that delivers a heavy or explosive charge, like a grenade launcher or a cannon. A Precision ranged weapon is something that fires typically one round with a lot of power behind the shot, like a crossbow or a semi-automatic rifle. A Repeating ranged weapon is something that fires in clusters, like spears from a Hwacha or a burst from an automatic rifle. A Spread ranged weapon is something that typically fires some kind of shrapnel instead of an individual shot, like a shotgun or a sling filled with gravel. See table C2 for ranged weapon damage by style and size.</p>
<p>Ranged weapons will typically have three different range values, a minimum range (typically 15m), an effective range, and a maximum range. When entering any combat, ranged weapon wielders (we'll call them marksmen for short) must choose whether they are aiming for close or distant targets. By spending a minor action, a ranged weapon wielder can switch between aiming for close targets and aiming for distant targets. Aiming for close targets allows ranged weapon wielders to move and attack targets freely, as long as those targets are within their weapon's minimum range. Aiming for distant targets, on the other hand, requires a ranged weapon wielder to move at half of their normal speed to fully utilize the effective and maximum range of their weapon (Rules for speed are detailed on the <a href="{{url_for('armor')}}">armor page</a>). While aiming at distant targets, a ranged weapon can be used to attack any target closer than the weapon's maximum range. However, if the target is closer than the weapon's minimum range or beyond the weapon's effective range, the wielder must min their stat die for accuracy checks.</p>

<h2>Elemental Weapons</h2>
<p>Sometimes a weapon will behave in a way that utilizes a raw application of matter. This is usally the case when wielding some kind of weapon that utilizes raw chemical reactions, such as a homemade flamethrower or a piece of ancient alien technology. Often these weapons will deal damage in an area of effect, rather than a single target. Because they are typically area of effect weapons, these type of weapons are always considered to be large in size. However, they will have distinct levels of power associated with the damage they deal. The five styles of elemental weapons are Force, Gaseous, Liquid, Solid, and Plasma. Each style is fairly self explanatory, indicating the element which is manipulated by the weapon. See table C3 below for elemental weapon damage by style and power level.</p>
