# Combat Techniques
A warlord swings his mighty maul, bending metal and breaking bones. A medic presses the defibrillator to a fallen comrade's chest, returning the spark of life. A single captain stands tall brandishing a tattered flag, inspiring the defenders to fight on. Roleplaying is full of heroic moments when the action gets fierce. The Simply Combat Techniques module gives each weapon their own unique abilities in combat, so heroes and villains can inspire these moments that much more often.

## Melee Weapons
### General

If you hit the target and roll sufficiently high enough to hit the location you chose, inflict some kind of detriment to them based on the area hit. If they were holding something and you hit their hand, they will likely drop it. If they were running and you hit their legs, they will likely fall. A latch mechanism that you hit could cause a trap to spring. Your gamemaster will determine the final outcome of a successful Aimed Strike.",
    "When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your accuracy increases. For each rank, you may Max an additional skill die when making your Accuracy check for this attack."

Treat your target's Awareness as the result of their Dodge roll for this attack, and the result of your Stealth roll as the result of your Accuracy and Potency checks for this attack.",
    "When ranked up as a part of a signature technique, your strike becomes capable of silently eliminating a foe. You may choose one of the following enhancements for each rank (you may choose the same enhancement more than once):
    • Your attack is well hidden, only your target is aware that you attacked at all. Additionally, if your strike kills your target, they die without a struggle. Even to close observers it appears as though they simply lost consciousness.
    • You may Max an additional skill die when performing your Stealth check"

    • You may move past your target if you have not moved your full movement speed, regardless of if you hit your target or not. For this attack, you may treat any enemy along the line you charged as within melee range of you.
    • You may carry your target with you if you hit with this attack and have not moved your full movement speed. If you collide with obstructions along this path, your target suffers an additional blow as if from an improvised weapon of the appropriate size of the obstruction, using your potency roll from this attack to determine the damage of the improvised weapon. You may continue to carry your target past each obstruction, provided you break through them or are able to knock them out of the way, until you have encountered a number of obstructions greater than the number of times you have chosen this enhancement."

If you are successful, your target is prevented from using any major or minor actions that require movement and skip their next turn. Additionally, you move at half speed and must min your stat die (or dice) on any skill check that requires movement. On their turn, your target may take a major action to perform a Grapple contest with you. If they are successful, they free themselves. If they are unsuccessful, they gain a +1 bonus to subsequent attempts against this Grapple.",

### Large Melee
{{ renderTechnique(
    "Intercepting Strike",

    • Record your potency roll for this attack. An enemy stunned by this attack must make an effort to even act. On each turn that the target remains stunned, they must make an Endurance check with a difficulty equivalent to your Potency roll for this attack. If they fail, they may not take any major actions on that turn.
