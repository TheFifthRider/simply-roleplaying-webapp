Skills and backgrounds are the cornerstone to character development and growth in Simply Roleplaying. Where stats represent the intrinsic attributes of a character (their strength, speed, etc.), skills and backgrounds represent the training and expertise that same character has gained over time. **Skills** represent the individual trained abilities and **backgrounds** represent  of mastery derived by combining several mastered skills together. 

## Skill Checks
Whenever a character attempts to do something in which the outcome is uncertain, the gamemaster will call for or make a skill check for that character. A skill check is resolved by rolling a _stat_ die, along with some combination of _skill_ and _background_ dice to meet or exceed a target number that represents the **difficulty** of the task the character is attempting to perform.

In most cases the gamemaster will determine what stats are applicable for the skill check in question and the player will offer up suggestions of skills and/or backgrounds that they have on their character sheet to add the dice associated with those skills and/or backgrounds. A character can contribute one skill or background die to a skill check per background they have on their character sheet, to a maximum of three.

<!-- GM Callout:
The most important thing about any skill check is to determine the goal and the consequences-- What are they trying to do? What happens if they succeed? If they fail? Additionally, while the difficulty of the task determines the line between success and failure, rolling significantly above or below that number should have appropriately significant consequences.-->

> A player's thief character is attempting to persuade a local merchant to not question the legality of goods he's selling, so his gamemaster asks him to make a charisma skill check concerning convincing the merchant.
>
> Consulting his character sheet, the player picks out his background Smuggler, and his die level 2 (1d6) skill in Intimidation as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation.
>
> His gamemaster finds these appropriate to the situation, so she approves them.
>
> The player then rolls his die level 4 Charisma (1d10), die level 2 (1d6) Intimidation, and 1d12 for this being relevant to his Smuggler background.
>
> He rolls a 2, a 1, and a 3 for a total of six--  not a great roll.
>
> The gamemaster knows that he needed a 10 to convince the merchant, so she determines the consequences of his action. Based on his use of the Intimidation skill on the merchant, she decides that he's going to start to get belligerent.

## Potential: Learning and Improving
In Simply Roleplaying, a character's proficiency with the skills they know is represented by a die, four sided through twelve sided. The more proficient a character is with a skill, the higher the die level of the die in question. A character who has a die level of one in a skill is considered to understand the bare minimum, where a character who has a die level of five in a skill is considered to have mastered that skill. [If you're not familiar with the concept of die levels, read about them here.]({{url_for('index')}}) 

Characters in Simply Roleplaying can start anywhere from seasoned adventurers to fledgling recruits, brimming with potential. **Potential** is a measure of your character's ability to learn new skills or grow existing skills, given a competent teacher and time to learn.

During character creation, the gamemaster will allot all of their players with a standard amount of potential to start the game with. More details on this can be found on the [character creation page.]({{url_for('startingCharacterCreation')}}) In addition, at the beginning or end of each session the gamemaster may grant the players some number of points of potential. 

### Spending Potential

Players can spend potential in one of two ways: either by being trained in a skill by a more experienced character or by experimenting on their own and gaining insight in a skill. In either case, they can choose to either **learn** the skill if they did not already know it, marking it as a level 1 Skill on their character sheet, or **advance** the skill, increasing the die level of the skill by 1.

### Training
Training is an intense period of study that characters can engage in over a period of several hours of downtime, given either a trainer or suitable materials to study from. At the conclusion of the **training**, as long as it was not significantly interrupted, the potential is spent and the character learns or advances the skill they were training. A character can act as a trainer for a skill provided that they have either mastered it or it pertains to one of their backgrounds.

### Gaining Insight

At any point after determining the result of a skill check, a player may declare that their character has **gained insight** in either a skill that was used for that check or in a skill that could have been used for that check, learning or advancing the skill.

### Mastering a Skill

When a Skill is advanced to die level 5, it is considered **mastered**, and can no longer be advanced.

## Skill and Background Guidelines

As you may have already figured out, skills are largely determined by the players in Simply Roleplaying. While some modules-- like the Simply Combat module --may define specifically named skills and backgrounds that have specific requirements or capabilities <!-- more here -->

As a rule of thumb; the more general a skill is, the more generic the character's expertise is considered to be. A character with a History skill would be able to apply it to broad questions about the past of a town, but wouldn't necessarily be able to apply that knowledge to the finer details of the ancient catacombs under the town like a character with an Archeology skill.

Here are some guidelines for determining skills, and examples of skills both general and specific.

Skills to augment Agility related checks primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are Acrobatics, Lockpicking, Dodge, Rubix Cube Solving, or Wirecutting.

Skills to augment Brawn related checks primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples are Climbing, Lifting, Swimming, Resisting Toxins, and Breaching Doors.

Skills to augment Charisma related checks primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples are Animal Handling, Bluffing, Intimidation, Logic, and Political Appeal.

Skills to augment Intuition related checks primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples are Gambling, Detecting Traps, Streetwise, Navigation, and Piloting.

Skills to augment Knowledge related checks primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples are Disarming Traps, Democratic Politics, Archeology, Sewing, and Bandit Culture.

## Using Multiple Skill Dice

A single task usually can become easier by using multiple related skills together. In Simply Roleplaying, this is represented by using multiple skill dice from different skills when performing a skill check. A character begins to be able to do this after their total dice level reaches 10. A character's **total dice level** is simply the sum of all of their die levels in all of their skills. When a character with sufficient total dice level makes a skill check, they may ask to apply a secondary and even tertiary skill to augment their primary skill. These supplementary skills must allow the character to perform their primary skill more effectively, but do not have the same stat restriction as the primary skill. As a character's total die level increases to specific benchmarks (shown in table SK2 below) they gain access to their supplementary skills.
