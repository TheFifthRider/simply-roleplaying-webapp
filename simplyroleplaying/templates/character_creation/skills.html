Skills and backgrounds are the cornerstone to character development and growth in Simply Roleplaying. Where stats represent the intrinsic attributes of a character (their strength, speed, etc.), skills and backgrounds represent the training and expertise that same character has gained over time. **Skills** represent the individual trained abilities and **backgrounds** represent broad mastery gained by combining several mastered skills together. 

## Honing your Skills

In Simply Roleplaying, a character's proficiency with the skills they know is represented by a die; four sided through twelve sided. The more proficient a character is with a skill the higher the die level of the die in question. A character who has a die level of one in a skill is considered to understand the bare minimum, where a character who has a d12 in a skill is considered to have mastered that skill. [If you're not familiar with the concept of die levels you can read about them here]({{url_for('index')}}). 

As stated in [character creation]({{url_for('startingCharacterCreation')}}), characters in Simply Roleplaying can start anywhere from seasoned adventurers to fledgling recruits, brimming with potential. **Potential** is a measure of your character's ability to learn new skills or grow existing skills, given a competent teacher and time to learn. During [character creation]({{url_for('startingCharacterCreation')}}), the gamemaster will allot all of their players with a standard amount of potential to start the game with. Additional potential is earned from milestones, which are discussed below.

### Spending Potential

Players can spend potential in one of two ways: either by being trained in a skill by a more experienced character or by experimenting on their own and gaining insight in a skill. In either case they can choose to either **learn** the skill if they did not already know it, writing it down as a 1d4 skill on their character sheet, or **advance** the skill, increasing the die level of the skill by 1.

#### Training

Training is an intense period of study that characters can engage in over a period of several hours of downtime, given either a trainer or suitable materials to study from. At the conclusion of the **training**, as long as it was not significantly interrupted, the potential is spent and the character learns the trained skill or advance that skill's die level. A character can act as a trainer for a skill provided that they have either mastered it or it pertains to one of their backgrounds.

#### Gaining Insight

At any point after determining the result of a skill check, a player may declare that their character has **gained insight** in either a skill that was used for that check or in a skill that could have been used for that check. When they do this, they may either learn that skill or advance that skill's die level. 

### Mastering a Skill

When a Skill is advanced to 1d12, it is considered **mastered**, and can no longer be advanced. A mastered skill can be taught to others or used in creating a background.

## Building a Background

Once a character has mastered five related skills, they can combine them together to form a **background** that summarizes the common ground between those five skills. Backgrounds can be added to skill checks like a skill and always add 1d12 to the skill check.

> A character had mastered Acrobatics, Dexterity, Lockpicking, Sneaking, and Traps, it would make sense for them to be able to combine them together into a background called _Thief_, since all of those skills are the kind a Thief might have.

When a character develops a new background, the skills combined into that background are erased from their character sheet, as their new background includes those skills. That is not to say that skills combined into a background cannot be learned again, however--  if they are, those skills represent additional expertise beyond what the character already has from their background. Further, no two backgrounds can have the same name. If a character combines the same five skills into a new background more than once, the name of the new background should show the skill gained beyond the first background.

> A roguish character with a Thief background has once again mastered Acrobatics, Dexterity, Lockpicking, Sneaking, and Traps. Since these skills represent their abilities beyond simply being a Thief, they create a new background called _Master Thief_.

## Skill and Background Naming Guidelines

As you may have already figured out, skills are largely determined by the players; there is no master list of skills. This means the sky's the limit as far as creating a skill or background goes. While some modules-- like the Simply Combat module --may define specifically named skills and backgrounds that have specific requirements or capabilities, a skill can usually be anything you train at-- from Juggling to Basket Weaving -- and backgrounds are even more freeform.

The trickiest part about being able to create your own skills or backgrounds is coming up with a good name. You want your names to keep a balance between the general and the specific. Ideally, your skills and backgrounds should both be expressive of what you want your character to be able to do while still remaining general enough that they can come up a lot in play.

Don't worry too much about coming up with the perfect name for a skill or background. It's good enough to just create a good name. Skills ultimately exist to be mastered and turned into backgrounds and, as long as you keep track of the skills used to create them, backgrounds should be renamed until they feel right.

### Naming a Good Skill

Names for skills are fairly rigid. Skills should describe a specific thing that your character has trained in. The more general the name of a skill is, the more generic the character's expertise is considered to be. A character with a _History_ skill would be able to apply it to broad questions about the past of a town, but wouldn't likely be able to apply that knowledge to find the age of the ancient catacombs under the town like a character with an _Archeology_ skill. Conversely, a character with an _Archeology_ skill wouldn't likely be able to apply it to uncovering facts about the recent political unrest of the town.

### Naming a Good Background

Names for backgrounds are more freeform. A good rule of thumb is to name your background something that you might use in a sentence to describe your character. Backgrounds could be jobs like _Blacksmith_, _Hacker_, or _Guerilla Sniper_, roles like _Healer_, _Tactician_, or _Tank_, or even quick descriptions like _Born in a Port City_, _Penny Pincher_, or _Iron Will_. Really, there's not much of a definition for what a background can or can't be; if it sums up both an aspect of your character and a spectrum of skills, it's probably a good background!

### Additional Skill/Background Examples

Here are some additional examples of skills based on a stat they work well with, and some background examples of how they might be combined. While skills are never limited by what stat you use them with, sometimes thinking about what stat you want to improve will help you decide on what kind of skill to learn.

Skills to augment _Agility_ related checks primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples are _Acrobatics_, _Lockpicking_, _Rubix Cube Solving_, _Sneaking_, or _Wirecutting_. If you were to combine those five skills, you could create a background named _Criminal Mastermind_.

Skills to augment _Brawn_ related checks primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples are _Breaching Doors_, _Climbing_, _Lifting_, _Resisting Toxins_, and _Swimming_. If you were to combine those five skills, you could create a background named _Military Commando_.

Skills to augment Charisma related checks primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples are _Animal Handling_, _Bluffing_, _Intimidation_, _Logic_, and _Political Appeal_. If you were to combine those five skills, you could create a background named _Druid Politician_.

Skills to augment Intuition related checks primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples are _Driving_, _Gambling_, _Navigation_, _Traps_, and _Streetwise_. If you were to combine those five skills, you could create a background named _Getaway Driver_.

Skills to augment Knowledge related checks primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples are _Archeology_, _Bandit Culture_, _Baking_, _Political History_, and _Sewing_. If you were to combine those five skills, you could create a background named _Gang Savvy Granny_.

## Milestones

Milestones are markers of when the player characters advance and are awarded to celebrate the significant things the players have accomplished over the course of the game. Typically, a milestone is only awarded once per session and at the end of the session, but gamemasters can award more than one milestone per session and/or milestones in the middle of the session if it seems appropriate.

### Every Milestone

Every milestone earns the character some amount of potential, varying based on the significance of what happened in the campaign. This is ultimately up to the gamemaster to determine, but about one to two points of potential per two hours of playtime is usually right for an average session.

A more interactive way of determining how many points of potential to earn at the end of a session is by setting milestone goals. Come up with a list of goals that start with "Gain a point of potential if we..."-- about one per hour you usually play. Then, at the end of each session, read each goal aloud. If the group met the goal, everyone gains a point of potential.

Here are a few example goals that should work for most campaigns, assuming a four hour session.

* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we come up with a witty title to remember this session by
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we accomplished something new and important
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about the world
* [ ] Gain a point of potential if we learned something new and important about one of the player characters

### Special Milestones

Special milestones typically occur at the end of significant arcs or whenever your gamemaster feels like it's appropriate for the party to get a power boost. Special milestones tend to grant a big chunk of potential and some other added benefit, based on the type of special milestone. A few types of special milestone are defined below.

Gamemasters, a good rule of thumb is to aim to give a special milestone about every 20 to 30 potential earned, and to grant roughly a session and a half's worth of potential when you do so. If you use milestone goals, this should happen more or less naturally as special milestones tend to come after sessions that have players check all the boxes. If it doesn't come naturally, feel free to come up with additional milestone goals for accomplishing significant arcs, defeating significant foes, or whatever best suits your campaign. The goal of milestone goals is to feel good about the concrete things you have done in the game world.

#### Skill MIlestones

Every skill milestone acquired increases the number of dice you can add to skill checks from skills and backgrounds. <!-- and also Potential -->

#### Stat Milestones

<!-- Increase one stat +3, one stat +2, one stat +1 -- and also potential -->

## Skills and Backgrounds in Action

Skill checks exist for whenever a character attempts to do something where there is a goal, a risk, and an uncertainty of whether either or both will happen. A skill check is resolved by rolling a _stat_ die, along with some combination of _skill_ and _background_ dice to meet or exceed a (typically secret) target number that represents the **difficulty** of the task the character is attempting to perform. 

### Resolving a Skill Check

In most cases the gamemaster will determine what stats are applicable for the skill check in question and the player will offer up suggestions of skills and/or backgrounds that they have on their character sheet to add the dice associated with those skills and/or backgrounds. A character can contribute one skill or background die to a skill check per background they have on their character sheet, to a maximum of three. <!-- no longer correct? -->

> A player's thief character is attempting to persuade a local merchant to not question the legality of goods they're selling, so their gamemaster asks the player to make a skill check with _Charisma_ to convince the merchant.
>
> Consulting their character sheet, the player notes that they have two backgrounds, _Smuggler_ and _Mercenary_, as well as three skills, _Acrobatics_, _Lockpicking_, and _Intimidation_. Based on their current goal, they picks out their background _Smuggler_, and their skill in _Intimidation_ as the relevant skills and backgrounds to this situation.
>
> The gamemaster finds these appropriate to the situation, so they approve them.
>
> The player then rolls their 1d10 Charisma, 1d6 Intimidation, and 1d12 for this being relevant to their Smuggler background.
>
> They roll a 2, a 1, and a 3 for a total of 6--  not a great roll. Fortunately, they have a +5 stat modifier to their Charisma, bringing the total up to 11.
>
> Unfortunately, the gamemaster knows that the player needed a 15 to convince this merchant, so the gamemaster determines the consequences of the player's action. Based on the player's use of the Intimidation skill on the merchant, the gamemaster decides that the merchant is going to start to get belligerent.

### Outcomes

Once the backgrounds, skills, and stat are all chosen, the dice are rolled and the gamemaster compares the total result to the difficulty of the check and describes what happens. If a character's roll meets or exceeds the difficulty of the skill check, they do whatever they set out to do with minimal risk. If a character's roll does not meet the difficulty of the skill check, that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't accomplish their goal-- just that they will suffer some kind of risk.

If a character rolls particularly well or particularly poorly compared to the difficulty of the skill check, the outcome should be that much more significant. When a character rolls more than 10 below the target number for a skill check, they suffer a **critical failure** and the risk they suffer becomes dramatically greater. Conversely, when a character rolls more than 10 above the target number for a skill check, they have performed a **critical success** and not only do they complete whatever goal they set out to do, but they also gain some kind of significant added benefit-- perhaps free from any risk, or success to a degree that none thought possible.

### Goals, Risks, and Uncertainty

To dig a little deeper into skill checks (players, feel free to skip this section), a skill check is fundamentally useless without a goal, a risk, and an uncertainty. Without uncertainty, the narrative clearly indicates what will happen and to roll the dice is only to provide the façade of agency. Without a goal, success means nothing to whomever is rolling, and the same is true for risks and failure.

Goals are a statement of intent, and should be more than just avoiding risks. To that end, goals should ideally be as specific as possible-- the goal is probably not to just dodge the swinging axe traps, but rather to get to the other side of the deadly blades so you can go on looting the tomb. While on paper this seems to fall a lot on the player to describe exactly what they are doing, the gamemaster should also be presenting possible options that the player can take to help them out.

<!-- TODO: Add some advice about talking to your players about this / introducing this concept in an introductory dungeon -->

Risks are negative consequences to any action. Risks can be as benign as taking a whole day to research something or as life-or-death as not avoiding the chainsaw rushing towards your chest. Risks should rarely just be failing to achieve a goal in a way such that the character couldn't just try again. A character shouldn't just attempt to push some boxes and find them unable to budge, failure should be them accidentally getting pinned beneath them or their efforts alerting a passing warehouse guard. Failing a researching skill check in an quiet town library should result in a sleepless night or missing a crucial detail.
