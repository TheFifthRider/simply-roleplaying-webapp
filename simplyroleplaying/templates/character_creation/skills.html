<p>Skills are the cornerstone to character development and growth in Simply Roleplaying. A <strong>skill</strong> is a trained ability that is closely linked to a stat. When a character attempts to do anything that could fail, they must make a skill check to see if they are successful or not. The gamemaster will tell the player which stat is required for the skill check. The player will then look at their character sheet to see if they have any skills that could apply in this scenario, and ask the gamemaster if they can use any that they think are applicable as their primary skill. A <strong>primary skill</strong> must match the stat that is required for the skill check. We will explore more of why it is called a primary skill later on in <strong>Using Multiple Skill Dice</strong>.</p>

<p>A concrete example: <i>George's thief character is attempting to pick a lock. His gamemaster informs him that picking the lock is an Agility check. George then consults his character sheet to see if he has any Agility skills that are applicable and finds Lockpicking, a skill that he can roll a six sided die for. He asks his gamemaster if he can use his Lockpicking skill in this case as his primary skill, and she agrees that he can. George then rolls the dice, getting a 9 on the ten sided die and a 2 on the six sided die. He adds them together and tells his gamemaster that he rolled an 11. The gamemaster knows that he only needed a 10 to pick the lock, and she informs him that he successfully picked the lock.</i></p>

<p>Any proficiency or action can be a skill, but no skill can be linked to the Luck stat. Rather than provide a comprehensive list of skills, Simply Roleplaying assumes that the players of the system will largely decide on their own for their characters to learn. The only exception to this rule is that other modules, like the Simply Combat module, may refer to specificly named skills. In cases like that, the module will define the skill and it's associated stat.</p>

<p>To make determining skills easier, here are some guidelines and examples. Skills associated with the Agility stat (Agility skills) should primarily focus on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some examples of what an Agility skill could be are Acrobatics, Lockpicking, Dodge, Rubix Cube Solving, and Wirecutting. Brawn skills should primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples of what a Brawn skill could be are Climbing, Strength, Swimming, Resisting Intoxication, and Breaching Doors. Charisma skills should primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples of what a Charisma skill could be are Animal Handling, Bluffing, Intimidation, Logic, and Political Appeal. Intuition skills should primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples of what an Intuition skill could be are Gambling, Detecting Traps, Streetwise, Navigation, and Piloting. Knowledge skills should primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples of what a Knowledge skill could be are Disarming Traps, Democratic Politics, Archeology, Sewing, and Bandit Culture.</p>

<h2>Potential: Learning and Improving Skills</h2>
<p>In Simply Roleplaying, the proficiency one has in each skill is associated with a die. The more proficient one is with a skill, the more sides the die tends to have. This metric is referred to as the die level of the skill. <strong>Die levels</strong> in Simply Roleplaying range from 0 to 5, 0 being no die, 1 being a four sided die (abbreviated as 1d4) and 5 being a twelve sided die (abbreviated as 1d12). All skills start at die level 0 to begin with. See table G1 for a full list of die levels.</p>

<p>Characters in Simply Roleplaying can start anywhere from seasoned adventurers to fledgling recruits, brimming with potential. <strong>Potential</strong> is a measure of your character's ability to learn new skills or grow existing skills, given a competent teacher and time to learn. At the beginning or end of each session the gamemaster may grant the players some number of points of potential. The players can spend this potential in one of two ways: either by being trained in a skill by a more experienced character or by experimenting on their own and gaining insight in a skill. At any point after performing a skill, a player may choose to improve that a character may <strong>gain insight</strong> in that skill, and expend a point of potential to increase that skill's die level to the next level. Gaining insight, however, is not something that happens every day. Consult your gamemaster about how often you will be allowed to gain insight. As a rule of thumb, players should be allowed to gain insight enough times so they are constantly gradually improving without spending more points of Potential than they are earning. Another way that players can spend points of potential is by recieving training in a specific skill, typically over the course of several hours, from another character. The other character must have a die level that is two die levels higher than the trainee in the skill that needs training, as no amount of instruction will allow a character to become equally skilled as their instructor- they have to gain their own insight. At the conclusion of the <strong>training</strong>, as long as the training was not significantly iterrupted, the trainee can spend a point of potential to increase the skill's die level to the next level. Unlike gaining insight, the only imitation to the number of times a character can train is the amount of in-game time they want to spend on it.</p>

<p>Before and after sessions are not the only way for a character to obtain potential. During character creation, the gamemaster will allot all of their players with a standard amount of potential to start the game with.

<h2>Using Multiple Skill Dice</h2>
<p>A single task usually can become easier by using multiple related skills together. In Simply Roleplaying, this is represented by using multiple skill dice from different skills when performing a skill check. A character begins to be able to do this after their total dice level reaches 10. A character's <strong>total dice level</strong> is simply the sum of all of their die levels in all of their skills. When a character with sufficient total dice level makes a skill check, they may ask to apply a secondary and even tertiary skill to augment their primary skill. These supplementary skills must allow the character to perform their primary skill more effectively, but do not have the same stat restriction as the primary skill. As a character's total die level increases to specific benchmarks (shown in table SK2 below) they gain access to their supplementary skills by increasing their secondary and tertiary skill level. <strong>secondary</strong> and <strong>tertiary skill levels</strong> are the maximum die level that can be used for secondary and tertiary skills, respectively. Skills that are above that level can be used as supplementary skill dice, but are reduced to the secondary or tertiary die level. It takes experienced characters to effectively mix skills and use the best of each.</p>
