Skills are the cornerstone to character development and growth in Simply Roleplaying. A **skill** is a trained ability that is closely linked to a stat. Skills are used with stats to determine how successful an action is. Where stats represent the intrinsic attributes of a character (their strength, speed, etc.), skills represent the training and expertise that same character has gained over time. When a player is asked to make a skill check, the gamemaster will first determine which stat is required for the skill check. The player will then look at their character sheet to see if they have any skills that could apply in this scenario and choose one that seems fitting. They then ask the gamemaster if they can use that skill as their primary skill. A **primary skill** must be a skill linked to the stat that is required for the skill check. If the gamemaster agrees that it is appropriate, the player may then have an opportunity to specify additional skills, as outlined below in **Using Multiple Skill Dice**.

A concrete example: *George's thief character is attempting to pick a lock. His gamemaster informs him that picking the lock is an Agility check. George then consults his character sheet to see if he has any Agility skills that are applicable and finds Lockpicking, a skill that he can roll a six sided die for. He asks his gamemaster if he can use his Lockpicking skill in this case as his primary skill, and she agrees that he can. George then rolls the dice, getting a 9 on the ten sided die and a 2 on the six sided die. He adds them together and tells his gamemaster that he rolled an 11. The gamemaster knows that he only needed a 10 to pick the lock, and she informs him that he successfully picked the lock.*

Both because skills are often setting specific and because there are a nearly innumerable amount of possible skills, Simply Roleplaying allows the players and their gamemaster complete control over what skills the characters in the campaign might learn. There are two exceptions to this freedom. The first is that some other modules, like the Simply Combat module, may define specifically named skills and their associated stats. The second is that no skills may be tied to the Luck stat, as there are no skills that can be derived purely from being lucky.

As a rule of thumb; the more general a skill is, the more generic the character's expertise is considered to be. For instance, a character with a highly leveled History skill would likely be quite knowledgeable about the general history of a town, but wouldn't necessarily know as much about the ancient catacombs under the town as a character with the same level Archeology skill.

Here are some guidelines for determining skills, and examples of skills both general and specific.

Agility skills should be learned abilities that primarily focus that rely on a character's dexterity, flexibility, and physical speed. Some Agility skills could be Acrobatics, Lockpicking, Dodge, Rubix Cube Solving, or Wirecutting.

Brawn skills should be learned abilities that primarily focus on a character's fortitude, endurance, and physical strength. Some examples of what a Brawn skill could be are Climbing, Lifting, Swimming, Resisting Toxins, and Breaching Doors.

Charisma skills should be learned abilities that primarily focus on a character's social ability and their ability to inspire emotions in others. Some examples of what a Charisma skill could be are Animal Handling, Bluffing, Intimidation, Logic, and Political Appeal.

Intuition skills should primarily focus on a character's awareness and ability to improvise. Some examples of what an Intuition skill could be are Gambling, Detecting Traps, Streetwise, Navigation, and Piloting.

Knowledge skills should primarily focus on a character's education, ability to retain facts, and their ability to understand and apply complicated concepts. Some examples of what a Knowledge skill could be are Disarming Traps, Democratic Politics, Archeology, Sewing, and Bandit Culture.

## Potential: Learning and Improving Skills
In Simply Roleplaying, a character's proficiency with the skills they know is represented by a die, four sided through twelve sided. The more proficient a character is with a skill, the higher the die level of the die in question. [If you're not familiar with the concept of die levels, read about them here.]({{url_for('index')}})

Characters in Simply Roleplaying can start anywhere from seasoned adventurers to fledgling recruits, brimming with potential. **Potential** is a measure of your character's ability to learn new skills or grow existing skills, given a competent teacher and time to learn. During character creation, the gamemaster will allot all of their players with a standard amount of potential to start the game with. More details on this can be found on the [character creation page.]({{url_for('startingCharacterCreation')}}) In addition, at the beginning or end of each session the gamemaster may grant the players some number of points of potential. The players can spend this potential in one of two ways: either by being trained in a skill by a more experienced character or by experimenting on their own and gaining insight in a skill. A character who has a die level of one in a skill is considered to understand the bare minimum, where a character who has a die level of five in a skill is considered to have mastered that skill.

### Gaining Insight
At any point after performing a skill, a player may declare that their character has **gained insight** in that skill and expend a point of potential to increase that skill's die level by one. Gaining insight, however, is not something that happens every day. Consult your gamemaster about how often you will be allowed to gain insight. As a rule of thumb, players should be allowed to gain insight enough times so they are constantly gradually improving without spending more points of Potential than they are earning.

### Training
Another way that players can spend points of potential is by recieving training in a specific skill, typically over the course of several hours, from another character. The other character must have a die level that is two die levels higher than the trainee in the skill that needs training, as no amount of instruction will allow a character to become equally skilled as their instructor-- they have to gain their own insight. At the conclusion of the **training**, as long as the training was not significantly iterrupted, the trainee can spend a point of potential to increase the skill's die level to the next level. Unlike gaining insight, the only imitation to the number of times a character can train is the amount of in-game time they want to spend on it.

## Using Multiple Skill Dice
A single task usually can become easier by using multiple related skills together. In Simply Roleplaying, this is represented by using multiple skill dice from different skills when performing a skill check. A character begins to be able to do this after their total dice level reaches 10. A character's **total dice level** is simply the sum of all of their die levels in all of their skills. When a character with sufficient total dice level makes a skill check, they may ask to apply a secondary and even tertiary skill to augment their primary skill. These supplementary skills must allow the character to perform their primary skill more effectively, but do not have the same stat restriction as the primary skill. As a character's total die level increases to specific benchmarks (shown in table SK2 below) they gain access to their supplementary skills by increasing their secondary and tertiary skill level. **secondary** and **tertiary skill levels** are the maximum die level that can be used for secondary and tertiary skills, respectively. Skills that are above that level can be used as supplementary skill dice, but are reduced to the secondary or tertiary die level. It takes experienced characters to effectively mix skills and use the best of each.
