Creating a character is all about dreaming up a concept, then figuring out how to realize it mechanically. There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character. If you're new to roleplaying games in general, consider writing a quick answer to the questions in the headers below as you build your character.

## What types of things are you best at? What types of things do you struggle with?
All characters have attributes about them that make it easier or harder for them to do specific things. This system uses stats to define these attributes. [Click here to learn more about stats.]({{url_for('stats')}})

When creating a character, each player gets a pool of 15 character creation points to spend on stats, unless otherwise specified. These creation points define the starting die level for their **Agility**, **Brawn**, **Charisma**, **Intuition**, and **Knowledge**. Every point they spend increase the die level of a stat of their stats by one, up to five.

## What have you learned?

Everyone has a variety of abilities that they have acquired over time through practice. This system uses skills and backgrounds to define those abilities. [Click here to learn more about skills and backgrounds.]({{url_for('skills')}}) Write up a background that summarizes the skills your character has learned so far. If you don't feel comfortable with doing that, or you feel like your character would not have built up a cohesive skillset, your gamemaster can allot you with a starting pool of 25 points of potential to spend on skills as you progress.

Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish, just make sure you always offer 25 points of potential per background should a player opt to not make a background.

## What is your story?

Motivations and experiences define characters in ways that no stat or skill possibly could. Each player should consider from where in their gamemaster's world they come from, and why they are seeking out to adventure with their fellow players. It can also be useful to describe their character's mental quirks and attributes, as well as any natural abilities that they may have that are not describable using other pieces of the system. In this system, advantages and disadvantages describe the benefits each character is awarded and challenges that each character grapples with in their lives. [Click here to learn more about advantages and disadvantages.]({{url_for('advantagesAndDisadvantages')}})

Accumulating advantages and disadvantages is a fairly simple process. A character can have any amount of advantages and disadvantages so long as the total ranks of character's advantages is equal to the total ranks of the character's disadvantages.

## What do you have with you?
Arguably the most important detail of any newly created character is the question of what they have with them. From bedrolls to mp3 players, what a character might carry with them in their day-to-day is telling of the other aspects of the character, like their personality and the circumstances of their life. Depending on the setting that the character is created in and that character's motivations for travel, they may have different things. A fantasy explorer, for instance, would likely have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, a grappling hook, and other such necessities. A science fiction diplomat, on the other hand, would likely have things like a universal translator, fine clothes, id card, hologram computer, a wax seal kit, a handful of fountain pens, a sheaf of paper, and other sophisticated items.

How the players determine what items their characters have with them is largely up to their gamemaster. In a typical campaign it would not be uncommon for a character to get a full set of armor, a primary weapon, an assortment of whatever things their character might have with them "on a typical day", and an assortment of items related to their current pursuits.

## What is your name?

Now that you have your character fleshed out, come up with a name that fits them
