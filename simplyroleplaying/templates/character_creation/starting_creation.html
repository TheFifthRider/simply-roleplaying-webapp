Character creation is intrinsically a player-focused activity, so this section will assume that the person reading it is a player. That said, gamemasters, you should read this as well-- it might even be good to read it aloud to your players at the table.

Creating a character is all about dreaming up a concept, then figuring out how to realize it mechanically. There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character. If you're new to roleplaying games in general, consider writing a quick answer to the questions in the headers below as you build your character.

## What are your natural strengths?
All characters have intrinsic attributes about them that make it easier or harder for them to do specific things. [Read up on stats]({{url_for('stats')}}), then choose either to **assign each stat a die** or **spend creation points**.

If you chose to **assign each stat a die**, rank your stats from best to worst-- no ties allowed. Your best stat is d12, your next best stat is d10, and so on. When you're done, each stat should be assigned a unique die between d4 and d12.

If you chose to **spend creation points**, you get a pool of 10 creation points to spend on the starting die levels of your stats. A d4 is 0 points, a d6 is 1 point, a d8 is 2 points, a d10 is 3 points, and a d12 is 4 points.

## What have you learned?

Everyone has a variety of abilities that they have acquired over time through practice. [Read up on skills and backgrounds]({{url_for('skills')}}), then choose to either **make a background** or **start brimming with potential**.

If you chose to **make a background**, write a background that summarizes the skills your character has learned so far.

If you chose to **start brimming with potential**, your gamemaster will allot you with a starting pool of 25 points of potential to spend on skills as you progress.

_Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish, just make sure you always offer 25 points of potential per background should a player opt to not make a background._

## What is your story?

Motivations and experiences define characters in ways that no stat or skill possibly could. Each player should consider from where in their gamemaster's world they come from, and why they are seeking out to adventure with their fellow players. It can also be useful to describe their character's mental quirks and attributes, as well as any natural abilities that they may have that are not describable using other pieces of the system. In this system, advantages and disadvantages describe the benefits each character is awarded and challenges that each character grapples with in their lives. [Click here to learn more about advantages and disadvantages.]({{url_for('advantagesAndDisadvantages')}})

Accumulating advantages and disadvantages is a fairly simple process. A character can have any amount of advantages and disadvantages so long as the total ranks of character's advantages is equal to the total ranks of the character's disadvantages.

## What do you have with you?
Arguably the most important detail of any newly created character is the question of what they have with them. From bedrolls to mp3 players, what a character might carry with them in their day-to-day is telling of the other aspects of the character, like their personality and the circumstances of their life. Depending on the setting that the character is created in and that character's motivations for travel, they may have different things. A fantasy explorer, for instance, would likely have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, a grappling hook, and other such necessities. A science fiction diplomat, on the other hand, would likely have things like a universal translator, fine clothes, id card, hologram computer, a wax seal kit, a handful of fountain pens, a sheaf of paper, and other sophisticated items.

How the players determine what items their characters have with them is largely up to their gamemaster. In a typical campaign it would not be uncommon for a character to get a full set of armor, a primary weapon, an assortment of whatever things their character might have with them "on a typical day", and an assortment of items related to their current pursuits.

## What is your name?
