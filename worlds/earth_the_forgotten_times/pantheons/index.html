                <h1 id="pantheons-of-the-forgotten-times">Pantheons of the Forgotten Times</h1>
<p>Legends speak of pantheons of deities that populated the Forgotten Times who granted their followers with a flow of magic through divine covenants, offering miracles for worship.</p>
<h2 id="animus">Animus</h2>
<p><strong>Worshipper Title:</strong> Beneficiary</p>
<p><strong>Deities in Pantheon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lunis</strong>, Father of Endings</li>
<li><strong>Sola</strong>, Mother of Beginnings</li>
<li><strong>Innumerable other Anima</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creation-of-the-world">Creation of the World</h3>
<p>The Animus believe that the Arch-Anima are benevolent beings that created the world from lifeless scrap that existed in the universe. The Animus believe that both the universe and the Arch-Anima have always existed and always will exist, with or without their believers. The Animus pledge their lives to their "benefactors" as a sign of showing respect for the gift of life they were given.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-world">The End of the World</h3>
<p>The Animus believe that the universe and the Arch-Anima will always live forever, and as such have no thoughts on the end of the world beyond the fact that some day there will not be any Animus left to worship the Arch-Anima, prompting the Arch-Anima to create new life.</p>
<h3 id="the-deities-role-in-the-world">The Deities' Role in the World</h3>
<p>The Anima believe that upon an area or grouping of people being consecrated by a priest of the Animus, a personal Anima will be created by the power of the Arch-Animi to watch over the consecrated location or individuals. Consecration is a high honor, and is typically only done if the group of people or the place is extremely important in the eyes of the Animus.</p>
<h3 id="worship-practices">Worship Practices</h3>
<p>Because Anima are created for specific locations or individuals, worshiping them is simply paying respect for their job. This can be done in any way the Animus determines, but is usually accomplished through feats of labor such as creating or maintaining a shrine or preparing regular offerings. It is generally believed that the more work done to honor the spirit, the more the worship is worth.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-priest">What Makes a Priest</h3>
<p>Becoming a priest of Anima requires that the Animus who wishes to become a priest take a pilgrimage back to the original shrine of Sola in a valley in Eurasia, followed by a dangerous trek through a mountain pass to the original shrine of Lunis. At both shrines, an elder priest records the Animus' entrance and provides mentorship for the Animus. The Animus becomes a priest if they are deemed worthy by both mentors.</p>
<h3 id="the-afterlife">The Afterlife</h3>
<p>The Animus do not believe in life after death -- instead, they believe their souls are absorbed back into the Arch-Animus from whence they came.</p>
<h2 id="court-of-celestials">Court of Celestials</h2>
<p><strong>Worshipper Title:</strong> Celestate</p>
<p><strong>Deities in Pantheon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primordial entities</strong> (not traditionally worshipped, but forces revered to hold great power)<ul>
<li><strong>The Darkness</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Light</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Sisters of Radiance</strong><ul>

</li>

<p><strong>Morrigan</strong>, Archangel of Temptations and Misery</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creation-of-the-world_1">Creation of the World</h3>
<p>Celestate believe that the universe is the realm of Light. When the Light formed the universe, its radiance created nine Archangels known as the Court of Celestials to govern it from the Celestial Terrace. However, when the creation of sentient beings began, the Court began to disagree. Lilith and Morrigan jointly proposed the idea that all creatures should serve the council, and swayed Avaria and Gabrielle. However the other Angels, championed by Serenia and Collete, rejected the proposal claiming it "Against the will of the Light."</p>
<p>Sneering at their sisters, Morrigan and Lilith bided their time, drawing power from the Darkness to amass an army of Dark Angels and attacked the Celestial Terrace in an attempt to seize control. They were driven back by the forces of Avaria and Zeriate and sealed within the realm of the Darkness. To separate themselves from those whom they banished, the remaining seven archangels named themselves the Sisters of Radiance, sworn to the will of the Light. Meanwhile, instead of being defeated by their new prison, Morrigan and Lilith swore themselves to the will of the Darkness and named themselves the Sisters of Shadow. They used their new powers to manipulate the realm to create the Nether Sphere, a dominion which was their own twisted world.</p>
<p>Teviyas abhorred the conflict between all of her sisters and attempted to convince the Sisters of Radiance to reform the Court, including the Sisters of Shadow. The Sisters of Radiance initially refused, but as cracks began to form between the realm of the Light and the realm of the Darkness, releasing all a manner of horrors. The Sisters of Radiance were only able to seal the rifts from the realm of the Light, leaving weakened barriers that could be torn back open quicker than the Sisters of Radiance could seal them. Teviyas out of pity and desperation went alone to the Nether Sphere to implore the Sisters of Shadow to help seal the rifts and rejoin the Court.</p>
<p>To win their favor, Teviyas offered Lilith and Morrigan rule over the creatures of the realm of Light who strayed from the Light's will and the two reluctantly agreed to rejoin the Court. The Sisters of Radiance had little choice but to accept the Sisters of Shadow's return as their help from within the realm of Darkness permanently sealed the rifts between the two realms. The Court was reformed with renewed purpose to keep watch over where the barriers between the realms were weakest, but the universe is a vast place. Reluctantly, the Court agreed to allow the Sisters of Shadow to create all manner of afflictions to test mortals, that they might prove themselves to be worth the Court's protection.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-world_1">The End of the World</h3>
<p>The Order neither believes that any apocalypse is imminent, nor that the Darkness is completely evil. However, an offshoot known as the Templars believes Lilith and Morrigan are forming up an army in the Nether Sphere to take over the world. There are other, smaller, denominations of the Celestate who embody different interpretations of the Council's will, but they are of negligible importance. Speak to your GM if you would like to be a part of an offshoot.</p>
<h3 id="the-deities-role-in-the-world_1">The Deities' Role in the World</h3>
<p>The Court primarily stays out of the affairs of the world. However, each Archangel is a guardian of an important virtue, and may affect the morals and events based around these virtues.</p>
<h3 id="worship-practices_1">Worship Practices</h3>
<p>Worshippers gather in a church and pray to the Court, singing their praises and asking for their guidance. Lilith and Morrigan are rarely worshiped, but when they are it is in an ancient, cult-like manner.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-priest_1">What Makes a Priest</h3>
<p>Priests must go through schooling in which they focus on interpreting the will of a specific Archangel.</p>
<h3 id="the-afterlife_1">The Afterlife</h3>
<p>Those who die and live a virtuous life become housed within the Council's halls, ruled over and protected by the Archangel which they most associate with. Those who do not become void spawn, the mindless servants of Lilith and Morrigan. Cults of the Twin Sisters of Shadows believe that the most loyal among them will become Dark Angels through a process called "The Calling," which would allow them to keep their free will to more adequately serve Lilith and Morrigan.</p>

<h3 id="creation-of-the-world_2">Creation of the World</h3>
<p>Those who follow the Deus pantheon believe that the world was created and every Deus born at the same time. As the world grew, so did the Deus-- for they were the world, and controlled its development. As the years rolled by, eventually they grew lonely with their power in the world. As the Deus grew more and more, they tried to fill the void they felt, accidently setting into motion the creation of the pangeans. Although this creation was accidental, the deities felt a new sense of purpose and responsibility and vowed to watch after this new life they created.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-world_2">The End of the World</h3>
<p>The Deus believe that the Gods are not immortal, but rather that they simply live for an incredibly long time. When the Gods start to die, the Deus believe that the world will begin to unravel. Similarly, any harm caused to the world is seen as harm caused to the Gods themselves.</p>
<h3 id="the-deities-role-in-the-world_2">The Deities' Role in the World</h3>
<p>The Gods are the world, they alone prevent it from falling apart. Since the Gods are the world, they may intervene as they choose within their realm of expertise to protect those who worship them.</p>
<h3 id="worship-practices_2">Worship Practices</h3>
<p>Each Deus has no definitive gender, though when they manifest they may choose a gender for the avatar that represents them. As such, it's very common for a Deus in one era depicted as one gender to suddenly be depicted as a different gender in another era. Traditionally, each of the deities are worshipped separately in their own temples with massive gatherings to celebrate what the Deus stands for. Unlike most other pantheons, each Deus is viewed as separate entities and are worshipped separately.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-priest_2">What Makes a Priest</h3>
<p>Priests of the Deus specialize in their knowledge of the teachings of individual Gods, however they are also expected to understand and respect the customs of other priests that worship the other Gods of the pantheon. A priest-to-be must make a pilgrimage to a temple of each of the Gods and be trained by an elder there, then return to the temple of their patron deity for special training before they are acknowledged as a priest of their deity.</p>
<h3 id="the-afterlife_2">The Afterlife</h3>
<p>Deus believe that after death, their souls are taken to the underworld by Noxorte, where they spend their time reliving their life from others who experienced contact with the deceased Deus at any point in the Deus' life. This begins with the deceased themselves.</p>
<h2 id="hexadivinus">Hexadivinus</h2>
<p><strong>Worshipper Title:</strong> Hexadivinite</p>
<p><strong>Deities in Pantheon:</strong></p>

</ul>
<h3 id="creation-of-the-world_3">Creation of the World</h3>
<p>All six of the the Lords and Ladies gathered together and worked together (for the first time) to create the universe and all therein as an elaborate environment for them to experiment on and play with. It is believed that they will not ever work together again until the end of the world.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-world_3">The End of the World</h3>
<p>Once the six are done with the universe, they will destroy it as their second collective action.</p>
<h3 id="the-deities-role-in-the-world_3">The Deities' Role in the World</h3>
<p>The six desired a relatively infinite realm of mirrors of themselves (in different parts), and thereby created the universe, that they might live together as a family in practically infinite ways and places, experiencing practically everything. A piece of each god is in everyone, so the only way to grow as an individual is believed to be that you must praise them all. Amongst them, Rutilun cannonically pursues Viren and Caesitas, both goddesses whom he cannot have- wooing them with every power at his disposal, but ultimately failing each and every time. Luteus and Pureum play an incredibly large and extravagant version of chess constantly, and Aurantiaco watches them all, and simply observes the other five's antics, stopping them from ruining the universe, should any of the five do something extreme.</p>
<h3 id="worship-practices_3">Worship Practices</h3>
<p>Worshippers are expected to find their inner god/goddess, whichever one calls to them the most- and live out their life in praise to that god/goddess primarily, and the other five secondarily. The gender of the god/goddess has nothing to do with the gender of the individual who is called to live out their life (A woman could have her inner God be Rutilun, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-priest_3">What Makes a Priest</h3>
<p>Priests are often defined as the best representatives of each lord and lady that are within the society- they are expected to act as much like the lord/lady they represent as they possibly can, from acting out legends to acting on only impulses that are thought to be from their specified god.</p>
<h3 id="the-afterlife_3">The Afterlife</h3>
<p>Since each life is actually just one of the lords/ladies' lives, it is expected that they will join their inner diety in the Outside, where all the Gods sit and learn about how they lived- each life telling their story to the others in a never-ending stream of stories and experiences, each as precious as the last.</p>
<h2 id="kollukt">Kol'lukt</h2>
<p><strong>Worshipper Title:</strong> Challenger</p>
<p><strong>Deities in Pantheon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vol'Kris</strong>, the Sky's Raptor<br />
  A dinosaur-like feathered creature who leaps with blinding speed</li>
<li><strong>Dra'kolobrum</strong>, the Grinding Oblivion<br />
  A serpent with a draconic head and many rows of acid-dripping teeth</li>
<li><strong>Ke'tu</strong>, Maw of the Deep<br />
  An enormous eel-like creature with an awful unhinging jaw</li>
<li><strong>Kani'tres</strong>, the Voracious Flame<br />
  A molten cerberus</li>
<li><strong>Invus</strong>, the Final Gatekeeper<br />
  A terrifying combination of the previous four creatures, depicted in myriad ways</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creation-of-the-world_4">Creation of the World</h3>
<p>Each individual has their own universe "created" when they are born as their own personal battlefield. Everything therein exists only to test them and make them stronger for the aftermath, when they will face the five colossi to determine their final resting place in the afterlife.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-world_4">The End of the World</h3>
<p>Each individuals universe ends as soon as they die, since they no longer need it for training. The possibility of the end of the creation and destruction of individuals is largely unexplored- as a kind of a... "who cares" sort of question.</p>
<h3 id="the-deities-role-in-the-world_4">The Deities' Role in the World</h3>
<p>The colossi's only role in the world is to keep the challengers flowing at them, perhaps from instinct or perhaps to some inscrutable end. Challengers of Kol'lukt view it as common sense to worship them and learn as much as they can about them so they can focus on defeating them. </p>
<h3 id="worship-practices_4">Worship Practices</h3>
<p>Becoming a challenge for the colossi is the ultimate form of praise to them. Challengers welcome any form of strengthening themselves or putting themselves to the test, and often duel each other to this end.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-priest_4">What Makes a Priest</h3>
<p>There are few priests of Kol'lukt, since most practitioners view the world as specially made for them to become stronger and see little point in sharing their beliefs with others around them. The priests that do exist tend to rely on their own fighting prowess, but can call upon the strength of previous combatants to augment their capabilities. These priests, however, know that when they finally die, they will not be able to rely upon borrowed help, but will have to face the colossi alone. For this reason, priests are incredibly uncommon.</p>
<h3 id="the-afterlife_4">The Afterlife</h3>
<p>Worshippers believe that upon their death they are sent to face the five colossi in a gauntlet to determine their final resting place. Vol'Kris is the first challenge, followed by Dra'kolobrum, Ke'tu, Kani'tres, and Invus, in that order. If defeated by any of the colossi, the challenger is believed to then serve that colossi until they deign to allow that challenger to return to the mortal world to prepare and try the gauntlet again. The worst fate that could befall a challenger in the afterlife is if a colossi judges that they are not worthy of trying again, and they remain bound in servitude forever. Defeating all of the colossi results in joining the ranks of the Champions in the outer world, feasting and fighting and living forever in bliss with the other Champions.</p>
<h2 id="magnusanctus">Magnusanctus</h2>
<p><strong>Worshipper Title:</strong> Follower</p>
<p><strong>Deities in Pantheon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Magnusancte</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creation-of-the-world_5">Creation of the World</h3>
<p>It is believed that Magnusancte created the universe and all in it in an endeavor to find the perfect people to fill his perfect city with, an ever-expanding utopia that he will always protect and always be loved by.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-world_5">The End of the World</h3>
<p>Once Magnusancte wishes to retire from judging everyone and just to simply live among his subjects, the gates of his city will close and the universe outside of his perfect city will be forced to remain alone with all of the evil of the world, forever without his guidance or protection. There are no apocalypse stories in Magnusanctus because his city is believed to endure forever.</p>
<h3 id="the-deities-role-in-the-world_5">The Deities' Role in the World</h3>
<p>Magnusancte has only one role in the world- to watch over it and keep track of what everyone does and how they do it.</p>
<h3 id="worship-practices_5">Worship Practices</h3>
<p>Magnusancte is worshipped in a church by a fairly large group of worshippers, lead by their priest. The services are largely teachings of the importance of the seven tenants on which Magnusancte will judge everyone: Purity, Gentleness, Diligence, Altruism, Steadiness, Communion, and Humility.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-priest_5">What Makes a Priest</h3>
<p>Priests of Magnusancte are expected to study the seven different tenants with seven different teachers and dedicate their life to them. After studying under their seven mentors, the new priest is expected to go forth and teach a unique combination of what they learned, teaching others the way of Magnusancte.</p>
<h3 id="the-afterlife_5">The Afterlife</h3>
<p>It is believed that the dead go before Magnusancte after they have died, seeking entry to his perfect city. If they pass his judgement, they will be allowed in. If they do not, they will be cast out and forced to live outside the city's walls with the evil of the world in a land of perpetual harsh conditions, natural disasters, and hordes of dangerous beasts.</p>
