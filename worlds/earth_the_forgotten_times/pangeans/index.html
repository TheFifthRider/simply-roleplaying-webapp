                <h1 id="pangeans-of-the-forgotten-times">Pangeans of the Forgotten Times</h1>
<p>There's a story that goes back ages about the first humans that lived on the supercontinent of Pangea. The story goes that there were but a handful of families of humans and each was offered a gift by the elements that made up the world. What they received transformed the entire family into something new and great, and they went forth and spread across Pangea.</p>
<p>The final family asked for nothing, but worried that the families who had so changed would forget about their shared roots. The elements offered them a gift not simply for them, but for all of the humans-- the gift of a magically shared language. No matter how different the humans became, they would always be able to understand one another.</p>
<p>Gradually, these variations on humanity earned names for themselves to represent the gift that so shaped their lives. When children are born from parents of different gifts, they may take on one, the other, or a unique mixture of both gifts. As a result, there's no telling whether this is a complete list of the original gifts that were given-- there may yet be more varieties of humans out there with new and strange gifts.</p>

<h2 id="dwarves">Dwarves</h2>
<p>These short, gray-skinned humanoids spend most of their lives underground, building huge underground cities and basing their economy around whatever they can mine. They are solitary pangeans that prefers to spend time among itself and have a deep reverence for stone and dirt. Dwarves have perfected the ability that they call "life forging", a combination of blacksmithing and magic that allows a group of dwarves gathered together to, when they perform the correct rites, take the soul of a near-dead dwarf and bind it into an object, creating a magical artifact that the near-dead dwarf can live in. Due to the near holy reverence that Dwarves give to stone, nearly all objects created this way are hewn from a single piece of stone. Depending on the rites performed the object can perform any variety of actions, but is typically limited to telepathically aiding and communicating with the person that is wielding the weapon.</p>
<h2 id="elves">Elves</h2>
<p>The idea of a beautiful creature so aligned with nature that it might have been there from the beginning almost spells 'Elf' in its description. Pangeans generally classified by their tall, slender appearance, and their uniquely shaped ears, the unique Elven facial structure is frequently quoted as being 'eerily beautiful.' Elves naturally grow to anywhere between 1.68-1.93 meters tall, and are frequently considered underweight for their height. Elves always have a particularly fair complexion, and have the natural array of human hair colors. Their facial structure is particularly angular, and they almost exclusively have almond-shaped eyes and tapered ears.</p>
<p>Their distinctive and aesthetically pleasing appearances belie the natural Elven inclination to be obsessed with beauty. Most Elves are so wrapped up in appearing fair that they will surpress the urge to display emotions at the risk of marring their beauty. Many Elves have become so focused on it that they tend to be prejudiced against individuals who they don't consider to be 'beautiful'. This often leads Elves to be exceptionally selective with breeding and are not inclined to accept Half-Elves (those  Elves sired in part by another pangean) into their midst due to their percieved impurity. This obsession with beauty also drives many Elves to experiment with modifying the world and its denizens with magic. If the world were to recognize them for what they were, it would be stunned by how frequently Elves were the culprit of it's favorite mythical creatures.</p>
<p>The Elves are known for being reclusive, hiding themselves away in clusters of hidden cities referred to as the 'Elven Lands'. The Elves operate on a meritocracy, a government of officials selected on the basis of their individual ability. As such, it's not uncommon for Elven cities to feature prominently displayed Thieves guilds since they reason that if someone was stolen from, they could not protect the stolen property adequately and therefore didn't deserve to own it in the first place.</p>
<p>Elven culture is firmly rooted in nature. Everything from their city names to their drinks tend to have names pertaining to trees or various plants or trees. Some of the largest Elven cities have a resident pair 'Grovemothers' or 'Grovefathers' who serve as the head of the community and commune with the surrounding trees and nature. The Elven lands are also filled with mysticism, with numerous areas reserved for 'Trials' or 'Rituals'. Religiously, most Elves tend to be Hexadivinites.</p>
<h2 id="faeries">Faeries</h2>
<p>Apart from the slight hue change in their skin tone, Faeries appear in nearly every way identical to elves, but still somehow fall short of the beauty of the elves when compared. However, unlike Elves, the Faeries are heavily aligned with magical elements. Each Faerie has an alternate form that they can switch to, comprised of the element they are aligned to. While in this state, the Faerie is unable to communicate with anything not made up of that element and cannot access any of the items they had previously on them, before they transformed. They are still normally susceptible to nonmagical attacks, but can remove wounds from themselves by absorbing nearby objects and elements of their elemental alignment, such as a campfire for fire, rocks for earth, and ice for water. Additionally, while in their elemental state, the Faeries' innate magic potential is doubled.</p>
<h3 id="fae">Fae</h3>
<p>Fae are the light aligned, yellow hued Faeries, and are the most organized of the Faeries. The Fae settle in large groups around anywhere with lots of reflective materials and in warm climates, as close to the sun as they can get. There are very few Fae cities, but those that do exist are large and ancient, covered in elaborate carvings and beautiful architecture. Fae who wander outside of their cities yearn for the comfort of being within those walls, and often will be searching for a way to take residence in the nearest one.</p>
<h3 id="gnomes">Gnomes</h3>
<p>Gnomes are the earth aligned, orange hued Faeries, and are the strongest, most independent of the Faeries. Gnomes generally do not settle together, but rather go their separate ways to seek their fortune in the world. They rarely journey across the sea, however, because they cannot stand not having solid ground under their feet. When Gnomes do settle together, they create elaborate underground cities that grow in size and complexity as more Gnomes settle in the city.</p>
<h3 id="nymphs">Nymphs</h3>
<p>Nymphs are the water aligned, blue hued Faeries, and are the most intelligent of the Faeries. Nymphs form small tribes near bodies of water and prize knowledge more than everything else. The love of knowledge is an incessant call, so Nymph are constantly nomadically traveling from place to place to learn what they can learn. Nymph's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair typically silky white or grey. Nymph tribes often cross each other's paths and trade goods and knowledge from which both tribes benefit, and Nymph caravans will often visit other pangeans in caravans to speak with them.</p>
<h3 id="salamanders">Salamanders</h3>
<p>Salamanders are the fire aligned, red hued Faeries, and are the most charismatic of the Faeries. Much like Nymphs, Salamanders nomadically travel in caravans and only settle temporarily in places. Salamanders are arguably the most nomadic Faeries, simply because they travel for the sole purpose of conversing with other pangeans and having new experiences. Salamander's eyes are almost always a shade of blue or grey and their hair is typically silky black or grey. It is not unheard of for Salamanders to split away from their caravans and find a new life in a city their caravan visits, should they find the place particularly enthralling.</p>
<h3 id="sylphs">Sylphs</h3>
<p>Sylphs are the wind aligned, green hued Faeries, and are the quickest of the Faeries. Sylphs are often known to be carefree and whimsical, a product of that sort of behavior being encouraged in their culture. Sylphs believe that physical swiftness or mental acuity are the best possible trait for any to cultivate. Due to this love of adaptability, Sylphs are nomadic like Nymphs and Salamanders. It is not uncommon for Sylph tribes to consist of a single family living in strange and harsh locations.</p>
<h2 id="gauntians">Gauntians</h2>
<p>Gauntian pangeans have an innate magical ability born from closeness to a specific type of animal; the ability to shift into an animal form. Each Gauntian has its own unique limitations to their transformation that governs what they can become, but generally they can transform at any time over the space of one round (no other actions may be made when transforming). Transforming is dangerous, too. Gauntians that stay in their animal form for too long are stuck in that form and cannot get out of it. Trapped Gauntians will slowly lose their sentience until they relapse into the mindset of a wild animal.</p>
<h3 id="aerogaunts">Aerogaunts</h3>
<p>Aerogaunts are a tribal society who can transform into birds. An aerogaunt can only become one kind of bird, and will display physical characteristics relating to that bird. Common physical characteristics are patches of feathers on their body around their neck and head, often blending with the hair on their head. Anomalies that can transform into multiple birds do exist, though they are rare. Talk to your GM if you want your character to be one of these anomalies. Aerogaunts typically gather together and form tribes, much like their bird forms would flock together. Most Aerogaunts can transform into a regularly sized bird, and cannot stay in their animal form for more than 24 hours or be trapped. These Aerogaunts retain their normal stats while transformed, but cannot transform into anything larger than 1.5m tall. There are, however, Aerogaunts that can transform into larger birds and larger forms of birds. These Aerogaunts are known as Dires, and transform into birds whose height tends to maintain their pangean height, regardless of the size of the original bird.</p>
<h3 id="aquagaunts">Aquagaunts</h3>
<p>Aquagaunts are a Gauntian that can transform into sea animals. They are similarly limited to Solumgaunts in size. More will be added here in the future.</p>
<h3 id="solumgaunts">Solumgaunts</h3>
<p>Solumgaunts are essentially the same thing as Aerogaunts, but with a few differences; they too are a tribal society who can transform, but they can transform into land animals. Like Aerogaunts, Solumgaunts can only become one kind of animal and display features relating to that animal; usually patches of fur or scales along their neck, a tail, and the ears of the animal that they transform into. Anomalies that can become more than one kind of animal do exist, albiet as a rarity. Talk to your GM if you want your character to be one of these anomalies. Solumgaunts typically gather and form tribes much like their animal forms would. Most Solumgaunts can transform into a regularly sized land creature, and cannot stay in their animal form for more than 24 hours or else they'd be trapped. These Solumgaunts retain their normal stats while transformed, but cannot transform into anything larger than a lion. There are, however, Solumgaunts who can transform into larger animals and larger forms of animals. These Solumgaunts are known as Dires, and can transform into animals whose forms nearly double in length to their pangean form's normal height.</p>
<h3 id="nexagaunts">Nexagaunts</h3>
<p>Nexagaunts have developed the ability to transform into a hybrid between their animal and human state, rather than a full animal state. These hybrid states tend to be about a foot larger than the Nexagaunt's pangean form.</p>
<h2 id="sasquatch">Sasquatch</h2>
<p>The 2 meter tall Sasquatch are fairly easy to distinguish from other forms of Giants because of the thick layer of brown, white, or black fur that covers their body. Most Sasquatch view clothing as "unnecessary fur", so seeing a Sasquatch with even rudimentary clothing is a rarity. Sasquatch tend to dwell in hutted tribes or in caves, often traveling in groups of less than a dozen.</p>
<h2 id="ogres">Ogres</h2>
<p>If bad feelings are felt towards Sasquatch, far worse feelings are felt towards their slightly taller (usually around 225 cm tall) cousins, Ogres. Ogres are generally considered to be more human due to the fact that they are not covered with fur and are typically wearing clothing, but considered far less human due to their tendency to be cannibalistic. Ogres believe that in order to grow stronger, one must devour the flesh of their opponent directly after defeating the opponent.</p>
<h2 id="trolls">Trolls</h2>
<p>Trolls are huge. That's pretty much the first reaction everyone has when encountering them. Among Ogres and Sasquatch, Trolls look the least like other pangeans, with an appearance like a giant hairless sloth. Most Trolls are stocky to withstand the harsh, cold tundras that they're often found in, and stand an impressive 2.5m tall.</p>
<h2 id="humans">Humans</h2>
<p>Averaging just under 2 meters tall, humans represent what is common between all pangeans. The term humanoid is often used interchangeably with pangean, and humans often have a way of using the common tongue in ways that other pangeans cannot.</p>
<h2 id="mer">Mer</h2>
<p>Mer are similar to most pangeans in size with gills positioned behind their ears and under their jaw. Additionally, Mer have a thin and extremely durable sheath of scales that can be used to bind their legs together into a seamless tail for quick swimming underwater, not unlike that of a fish.</p>
<h2 id="deep-ones">Deep Ones</h2>
<p>Deep Ones are ancient beings of the water that dwell on the ocean floor. Their bones are thinly coated in muscle, and chunks of seaweed and coral is often stuck to their limp, slick green skin. They are amphibious, and have much love of water and the creatures that reside therein. Unfortunately, Deep Ones have difficulty communicating with other pangeans, as they never developed a mouth. As a result, they communicate telepathically and have an innate affinity with magic. They have both lungs and gills, and can use either at will. Regardless of this fact, they must remain hydrated in the same way that vampires must feast on blood, so they tend to prefer the comforting wetness of the briny deep.</p>
<h2 id="goblins">Goblins</h2>
<p>Short, a bit spindly, with large hooked noses Goblins tend to have pale skin with a hint of green instead of the typical red flush to their skintone. Most stand around 1.5 meters tall and are notoriously spontaneous. Their culture will often create sprawling camps that have multiple layers of walls, simply because they created the first camp with exactly enough space for everyone and dealt with the subsequent population booms with an equal amount of foresight. They do not build things to last and are known to periodically move to a new home because they were bored of their previous one.</p>
<h2 id="orcs">Orcs</h2>
<p>Pale skin with an ever so slightly green tint to it, wild black hair, and heavily muscled bodies are some of the first impressions that most have when encountering Orcs. As tenacious as they are intimidating, Orcs tend to be courageous and can endure even the most painful of hardships, sometimes even as well as fiends. Orcs are among the most honest people that anyone may encounter, something which comes as both a blessing and a curse, as they can easily enrage other pangeans whose diplomatic relations requires more "tact." They form tribes of reasonable sizes and prefer to create their camps out of proof of their strength, such as hide huts from hunting and such. There <em>are</em> many Orc cities made out of stone, but most Orcs settle in tribal encampments.</p>
<h2 id="djinn">Djinn</h2>
<p>Djinn are pangeans whose gift transforms their entire body into a swirling mass of energy. They are similar to revenants, but far more stable as they were transformed by their gift.</p>
<h2 id="fiends">Fiends</h2>
<p>Fiends are a proud, towering, obsidian-skinned pangean with antler-like horns sprouting from their brow. In their own language, there is no word for a distinction between the different pangeans, merely a difference in strength. In their own tongue, they are "strong ones" -- an appropriate name when one considers their naturally developing muscles and over 2 meter average height. A fierce, proud pangean, the Fiends are the founders of the Kol'lukt religion, and most Fiends are practitioners of that religion.</p>
<h2 id="changeling">Changeling</h2>
<p>Changelings were the exact same as Fiends at one time, but disliked their heavily muscled form-- preferring instead the beauty of the other pangeans. Their desire to mimic the other pangeans prompted magical interference with their own genetic makeup, eventually allowing them to shift their physical features at will into seamless replicas of others (This does not change the Changeling's stats). Changelings are genderless, and often change their gender and racial appearance at will.</p>
<h2 id="revenants">Revenants</h2>
<p>Revenants are often referred to as being "undead", but such a term is a broadly incorrect categorization of what revenants truly are. Revenants are magic users who have had their lifespan extended by the binding of their soul to organic material through magical bonds, somewhat similar to the Dwarven method of "life forging". When a creature is born, their soul is tethered to their body by a cord of life energy; when they die, that cord breaks. Revenants are created by gluing the cord back on with magic, albiet crudely. </p>
<p>The most pressing concern with being a Revenant is that their skin and bones cease growing and only deteriorate, requiring them to constantly graft new parts onto themselves. While newly created Revenants look pretty much exactly how they did when they died, older ones have been known to look more than a little bit creepy, with parts grafted where they do not naturally appear. Because they are created with a magical tether, revenants can be killed with a forcible enough disenchantment.</p>
<h2 id="vampires">Vampires</h2>
<p>Vampires are a broad class of pangean that are most commonly associated with bats. It is unknown from whence their origin comes, but it is speculated that High Vampires spread the disease among some kind of bat-like animal that, over the generations, became more pangean, resulting in the birth of the first Hellpire. The theory further states that Cave Vampires came from the crossbreeding of the Hellpires and other pangeans.</p>
<h3 id="cave-vampires">Cave Vampires</h3>
<p>Cave Vampires live in the crypts of large, usually abandoned structures. Cave Vampires are most commonly recognized by their sunken eyes, bat-like wings that sprout out of their backs, and their deceptively bony muscular build.</p>
<h3 id="hellpires">Hellpires</h3>
<p>Hellpires are possibly the most feared form of Vampire. Living almost exclusively in caves, Hellpires are much like High Vampires in that they usually appear as a regular humanoid. However, this is not because of a mastery of changing themselves, but rather an innate ability to project a humanoid shape and sized illusion of themselves. When their illusion has been dispelled (whether by themselves or by a magic user of a high enough skill), they appear as gigantic humanoid bats approximately 3 meters tall.</p>
<h3 id="high-vampires">High Vampires</h3>
<p>When a High Vampire bites another pangean, they have the ability to seal away another pangean's gift and replace it with High Vampirism, though other vampires and Revenants are immune to High Vampirism. Blending in seamlessly with their surroundings, High Vampires look exactly like they once did, and can change their facial and bodily features at will with innate magic. However, they cannot change their particularly long canines that develop upon being bitten.</p>
