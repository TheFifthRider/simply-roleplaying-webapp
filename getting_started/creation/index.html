                <h1 id="creating-a-character">Creating a Character</h1>
<p>Character creation is a player-focused activity, so this section will assume that the person reading it is a player. That said, gamemasters, you should read this as well-- it might even be good to read it aloud to your players at the table.</p>
<p>Creating a character is all about dreaming up a concept, then figuring out how to realize it mechanically. There is no specific order that one must follow when creating a character in Simply Roleplaying, so players should feel free to skip around as they define their character. If you're new to roleplaying games in general, you may want to start by writing an answer to each of the headings before you read the text under them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-comes-naturally-to-you">What comes naturally to you?</h2>
<p>Your starting speed is 3m. This measures the amount of distance you can travel in a few seconds-- the length of <a href="../../gameplay/action/#moving-your-speed">an action</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, all characters have intrinsic attributes about them that make it easier or harder for them to do specific things. <a href="../../character/attributes/">Read up on attributes</a>, then choose either to <strong>rank your attributes</strong> or <strong>spend creation points</strong>.</p>
<p>If you chose to <strong>rank your attributes</strong>, order your attributes from what your character should be best at to what your character should be worst at. Set your best attribute to d12 and your second best attribute to d10. Then set your worst attribute to d4, and your second worst attribute to d6. Finally, set the remaining two attributes to d8.</p>
<p>If you chose to <strong>spend creation points</strong>, you get a pool of 12 creation points to spend on the starting size of your attributes. A d4 is 0 points, a d6 is 1 point, a d8 is 2 points, a d10 is 3 points, and a d12 is 4 points.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-stress-can-you-handle">How much stress can you handle?</h3>
<p>Once you've done that, it's time to calculate the maximum amount of damage your character can sustain. Read up on <a href="../../character/damage_and_injuries/">damage</a>, then calculate your maximum damage by adding twelve to the highest possible value you can roll on your character's brawn die.</p>
<p><code>Maximum Damage = 12 + Best possible roll on brawn die</code></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-has-your-past-taught-you">What has your past taught you?</h2>
<p><a href="../../character/skills/">Read up on skills and backgrounds</a>, then choose to either <strong>make a background</strong> or <strong>start brimming with potential</strong>.</p>
<p>If you chose to <strong>make a background</strong>, write a background that summarizes the skills your character has learned so far.</p>
<p>If you chose to <strong>start brimming with potential</strong>, your gamemaster will allot you with a starting pool of 15 points of potential to spend on skills as you progress.</p>
<p><em>Gamemasters, you can offer more than one starting background if you wish, just make sure you always offer 15 points of potential per background should a player opt to not make a background.</em></p>
<h3 id="what-unique-thing-can-you-do">What unique thing can you do?</h3>
<p>Whether you choose to make a background or start with potential, you'll also create an ability that sets you apart from other characters. <a href="../../character/abilities/">Read up on abilities,</a> then work with your GM to pick or create one for your character.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-story">What is your story?</h2>
<p>Motivations and experiences define characters in ways that no natural or learned ability possibly could. Each player should consider where in the campaign world they come from, and why they are seeking out to adventure with their fellow players. <a href="../../character/legacy/">Read up on legacies</a> and pick a few to help develop your character's history further.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-have-with-you">What do you have with you?</h2>
<p>How the players determine what items their characters have with them is largely up to their gamemaster. In a typical campaign it would not be uncommon for a character to get a full set of armor, a primary weapon, an assortment of whatever things their character might have with them "on a typical day", and an assortment of items related to their current pursuits.</p>
<p>A tomb explorer would likely have a bedroll, tent, backpack, mess kit, pack of torches, medical supplies, a grappling hook, and other such necessities.</p>
<p>A starship diplomat, on the other hand, would likely have things like a universal translator, fine clothes, id card, hologram computer, a wax seal kit, a handful of fountain pens, a sheaf of paper, and other sophisticated items.</p>
<p>From bedrolls to mp3 players, what a character might carry with them in their day-to-day is telling of personality, circumstances of life, and so many other things. Consider also carrying an object of personal significance to your character, such as a an old, handwritten journal or a locket carrying an irreplaceable lock of grey hair.</p>
<p>Once you've finished figuring out what you've got, read up on <a href="../../character/equipment/">equipment</a> and add equipment tags to anything that would benefit from having them. Be sure to talk to your gamemaster about the equipment and tags you've chosen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-look-like">What do you look like?</h2>
<p>Describe your character! What's their heritage? Are they young or old?  Thick or scrawny? What color skin? Eyes? Hair? What colors of clothing do they wear? How does their equipment look on them? Is it shiny and new? Dingy and poorly cared for? Ill fitting? Tailor-made? Be sure to pick a defining visual characteristic or two that highlights their history or personality.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-name">What is your name?</h2>
<p>Now that you know everything about them, what kind of a name fits your character? Do they use their full name or a nickname? Do they know their family name? Are they proud of it?</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can choose a name early and use that to help figure out answers to other questions!</p>
