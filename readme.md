# Simply Roleplaying Webapp
The webapp code behind the system (and the system itself!)

## Building the webapp
The webapp is a simple Flask webapp, built with Python 3.

## Running the website locally
The webapp is packaged with both waitress (for Windows machines) and gunicorn (for Linux / OSX machines) to serve the Flask server locally.
runServer.sh will pick which of these to use and will host the website on port 80 of your localhost.
